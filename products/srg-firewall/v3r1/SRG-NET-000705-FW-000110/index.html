       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       DoS events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of DoS events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of DoS attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to DoS events.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the firewall is configured to employ organization-defined controls by type of DoS to achieve the DoS objective.<br /><br />If the firewall is not configured to employ organization-defined controls by type of DoS to achieve the DoS objective, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the firewall to employ organization-defined controls by type of DoS to achieve the DoS objective.
