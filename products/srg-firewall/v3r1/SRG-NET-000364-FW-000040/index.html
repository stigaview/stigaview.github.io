       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Application inspection enables the firewall to control traffic based on different parameters that exist within the packets such as enforcing application-specific message and field length. Inspection provides improved protection against application-based attacks by restricting the types of commands allowed for the applications. Application inspection all enforces conformance against published RFCs.<br /><br />Some applications embed an IP address in the packet that needs to match the source address that is normally translated when it goes through the firewall. Enabling application inspection for a service that embeds IP addresses, the firewall translates embedded addresses and updates any checksum or other fields that are affected by the translation. Enabling application inspection for a service that uses dynamically assigned ports, the firewall monitors sessions to identify the dynamic port assignments, and permits data exchange on these ports for the duration of the specific session. <br />

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Review the firewall configuration to verify that inspection for applications deployed within the network is being performed on all interfaces.<br />If the firewall is not configured to inspect all inbound and outbound traffic at the application layer, this is a finding.<br />

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the firewall to inspect all inbound and outbound traffic at the application layer.
