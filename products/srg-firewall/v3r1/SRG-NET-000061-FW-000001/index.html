       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Remote access devices (such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems) that lack automated capabilities increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.<br /><br />Remote access is access to DoD non-public information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network.<br /><br />Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities from a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets).

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Review the firewall configuration statements used to create a group policy with filtering rules for remote clients accessing the network using a VPN.<br /><br />Verify both ingress and egress traffic on this interface is subject to the remote access policy and filtering rules required by the organization. <br /><br />If the firewall is used to filter traffic from the VPN access points but is not configured with filtering rules that apply to the monitoring of remote access traffic, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure a group policy for remote clients and apply to the interface that is connected to allow ingress and egress to the VPN access points.
