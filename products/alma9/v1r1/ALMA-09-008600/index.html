       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.<br /><br />System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.<br /><br />The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DOD policy. Use the following verbiage for operating systems that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:<br /><br />"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.<br /><br />By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:<br /><br />-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.<br /><br />-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.<br /><br />-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.<br /><br />-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.<br /><br />-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."<br /><br />Use the following verbiage for operating systems that have severe limitations on the number of characters that can be displayed in the banner:<br /><br />"I've read & consent to terms in IS user agreem't."<br /><br />If a login banner is not displayed, it may be difficult to prosecute an attacker.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000023-GPOS-00006, SRG-OS-000228-GPOS-00088

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Note: This requirement assumes the use of the default graphical user interface, the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable. <br /><br />Verify AlmaLinux OS 9 displays a banner before granting access to the operating system via a graphical user logon.<br /><br />First, identify the location of the banner message file with the following command:<br /><br />$ grep banner-message-text /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*<br /><br />/etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message<br /><br />Determine if the operating system displays a banner at the logon screen with the following command:<br /><br />$ gsettings get org.gnome.login-screen banner-message-enable<br /><br />true<br /><br />Next, check that file contains the correct wording with the following command (substituting the path from above):<br /><br />$ cat /etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message<br /><br />If the banner is set correctly it will return the following text:<br /><br />"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.<br /><br />By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:<br /><br />-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.<br /><br />-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.<br /><br />-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.<br /><br />-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.<br /><br />-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."<br /><br />If the banner text does not match the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner exactly, or the dconf database does not include the "banner-message-text" setting or if it is not enabled, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure AlmaLinux OS 9 to display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system via a graphical user logon.<br /><br />Create a database to contain the systemwide graphical user logon settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:<br /><br />$ touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message<br /><br />Add the following lines to the [org/gnome/login-screen] section of the "/etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message":<br /><br />[org/gnome/login-screen]<br />banner-message-enable=true<br />banner-message-text='You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.\nBy using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:\n-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.\n-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.\n-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.\n-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.\n-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants.
