       The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.<br /><br />Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.<br /><br />The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.<br /><br />Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.<br /><br />AlmaLinux OS 9 uses the PAM pwquality module as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. Configurations are set in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or further *.conf files within the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/" directory.<br /><br />The "minlen" parameter acts as a score of complexity based on the credit components of the pwquality module. By setting the credit to a negative value, not only will those components be required, but they will not count toward the total score of minlen. This will result in minlen requiring a 15-character minimum.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify that AlmaLinux OS 9 enforces a minimum 15-character password length with the following command:<br /><br />$ grep -r minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf*<br /><br />/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/stig.conf:minlen = 15<br /><br />If the value of "minlen" is less than 15, is not set, is commented out, or if conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure AlmaLinux OS 9 to require a minimum 15-character password length by setting the "minlen" option.<br /><br />Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a configuration file in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/" directory:<br /><br />minlen = 15<br /><br />Remove any configurations that conflict with the above value.
