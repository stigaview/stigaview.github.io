       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.<br /><br />Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.<br /><br />Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. <br /><br />Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.<br /><br />Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify that all network connections associated with SSH traffic are automatically terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity.<br /><br />Check that the "ClientAliveInterval" variable is set to a value of "600" or less by performing the following command:<br /><br /># sudo grep -i clientalive /etc/ssh/sshd_config<br /><br />ClientAliveInterval 600<br /><br />If "ClientAliveInterval" does not exist, is not set to a value of "600" or less in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or is commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the Ubuntu operating system to automatically terminate all network connections associated with SSH traffic at the end of a session or after a 10 minute period of inactivity.<br /><br />Modify or append the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file replacing "[Interval]" with a value of "600" or less:<br /><br />ClientAliveInterval 600<br /><br />In order for the changes to take effect, the SSH daemon must be restarted.<br /><br /># sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
