       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.<br /><br />Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.<br /><br />Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints).

       <h3>Check</h3>
       If the system is not networked this requirement is Not Applicable.<br /><br />The system clock must be configured to compare the system clock at least every 24 hours to the authoritative time source.<br /><br />Check the value of "maxpoll" in the "/etc/chrony/chrony.conf" file with the following command:<br /><br /># sudo grep maxpoll /etc/chrony/chrony.conf<br />server tick.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16<br /><br />If the "maxpoll" option is set to a number greater than 16 or the line is commented out, this is a finding.<br /><br />Verify that the "chrony.conf" file is configured to an authoritative DoD time source by running the following command:<br /><br /># grep -i server /etc/chrony/chrony.conf<br />server tick.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16<br />server tock.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16<br />server ntp2.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16<br /><br />If the parameter "server" is not set, is not set to an authoritative DoD time source, or is commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       If the system is not networked this requirement is Not Applicable.<br /><br />To configure the system clock to compare the system clock at least every 24 hours to the authoritative time source, edit the "/etc/chrony/chrony.conf" file. Add or correct the following lines, by replacing "[source]" in the following line with an authoritative DoD time source.<br /><br />server [source] iburst maxpoll = 16<br /><br />If the "chrony" service was running and the value of "maxpoll" or "server" was updated then the service must be restarted using the following command:<br /><br /># sudo systemctl restart chrony.service
