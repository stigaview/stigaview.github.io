       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Remote access to the web server is any access that communicates through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access can be used to access hosted applications or to perform management functions.<br /><br />A web server can be accessed remotely and must be capable of restricting access from what the DoD defines as non-secure zones. Non-secure zones are defined as any IP, subnet, or region defined as a threat to the organization. The non-secure zones must be defined for public web servers logically located in a DMZ, as well as private web servers with perimeter protection devices. By restricting access from non-secure zones through internal web server access lists, the web server can stop or slow denial of service (DoS) attacks on the web server.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Note: This requirement applies to the Web Management Service. If the Web Management Service is not installed, this is Not Applicable.<br /><br />Open the IIS 10.0 Manager.<br /><br />Click the IIS 10.0 web server name.<br /><br />Under "Management", double-click "Management Service".<br /><br />If "Enable remote connections" is not selected, this is Not Applicable.<br /><br />If "Enable remote connections" is selected, review the entries under "IP Address Restrictions".<br /><br />Verify only known, secure IP ranges are configured as "Allow".<br /><br />If "IP Address Restrictions" are not configured or IP ranges configured to "Allow" are not restrictive enough to prevent connections from nonsecure zones, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Open the IIS 10.0 Manager.<br /><br />Click the IIS 10.0 web server name.<br /><br />Under "Management", double-click "Management Service".<br /><br />Stop the Web Management Service under the "Actions" pane.<br /><br />Configure only known, secure IP ranges as "Allow".<br /><br />Select "Apply" in "Actions" pane.<br /><br />Restart the Web Management Service under the "Actions" pane.
