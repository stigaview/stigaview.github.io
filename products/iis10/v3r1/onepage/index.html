          Log files are a critical component to the successful management of an IS used within the DoD. By generating log files with useful information, web administrators can leverage them in the event of a disaster, malicious attack, or other site specific needs.<br /><br />Ascertaining the correct order of the events that occurred is important during forensic analysis. Events that appear harmless by themselves might be flagged as a potential threat when properly viewed in sequence. By also establishing the event date and time, an event can be properly viewed with an enterprise tool to fully see a possible threat in its entirety.<br /><br />Without sufficient information establishing when the log event occurred, investigation into the cause of event is severely hindered. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application-specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control, or flow control rules invoked.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000093-WSR-000053, SRG-APP-000095-WSR-000056, SRG-APP-000096-WSR-000057, SRG-APP-000097-WSR-000058, SRG-APP-000097-WSR-000059

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Internet Information Services (IIS) on Windows Server 2012 provides basic logging capabilities. However, because IIS takes some time to flush logs to disk, administrators do not have access to logging information in real-time. In addition, text-based log files can be difficult and time-consuming to process.<br /><br />In IIS 10.0, the administrator has the option of sending logging information to Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). This option gives the administrator the ability to use standard query tools, or create custom tools, for viewing real-time logging information in ETW. This provides a significant advantage over parsing text-based log files that are not updated in real time.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-APP-000092-WSR-000055, SRG-APP-000108-WSR-000166, SRG-APP-000358-WSR-000063

          Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the events cannot be determined.<br /><br />Ascertaining the correct source (e.g., source IP), of the events is important during forensic analysis. Correctly determining the source of events will add information to the overall reconstruction of the loggable event. By determining the source of the event correctly, analysis of the enterprise can be undertaken to determine if events tied to the source occurred in other areas within the enterprise.<br /><br />A web server behind a load balancer or proxy server, when not configured correctly, will record the load balancer or proxy server as the source of every loggable event. When looking at the information forensically, this information is not helpful in the investigation of events. The web server must record with each event the client source of the event.

Office suites, development tools, and graphic editors are examples of such troublesome programs.<br /><br />Individual productivity tools have no legitimate place or use on an enterprise production web server and are prone to security risks. The web server installation process must provide options allowing the installer to choose which utility programs, services, and modules are to be installed or removed.

A user with too much access can view information that is not needed for the user's job role, or the user could use the function in an unintentional manner.<br /><br />A MIME tells the web server the type of program, various file types, and extensions and what external utilities or programs are needed to execute the file type.<br /><br />A shell is a program that serves as the basic interface between the user and the operating system to ensure hosted application users do not have access to these programs.

Web Distributed Authoring (WebDAV) is an extension to the HTTP protocol which, when developed, was meant to allow users to create, change, and move documents on a server, typically a web server or web share. Allowing this functionality, development, and deployment is much easier for web authors.<br /><br />WebDAV is not widely used and has serious security concerns because it may allow clients to modify unauthorized files on the web server.

          Mobile code in hosted applications allows the developer to add functionality and displays to hosted applications that are fluid, as opposed to a static web page. The data presentation becomes more appealing to the user, is easier to analyze, and is less complicated to navigate through the hosted application and data.<br /><br />Some mobile code technologies in use in today's applications are: Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF, Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. The DoD has created policies that define the usage of mobile code on DoD systems. The usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on organizational servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations.<br /><br />Source code for a Java program is often stored in files with either .java or .jpp file extensions. From the .java and .jpp files the Java compiler produces a binary file with an extension of .class. The .java or .jpp file could therefore reveal sensitive information regarding an application's logic and permissions to resources on the server.

          The separation of user functionality from web server management can be accomplished by moving management functions to a separate IP address or port.

          ASP.NET provides a session state, which is available as the HttpSessionState class, as a method of storing session-specific information that is visible only within the session. ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session and provides the ability to persist variable values for the duration of that session.<br /><br />When using the URI mode for cookie settings under session state, IIS will reject and reissue session IDs that do not have active sessions. Configuring IIS to expire session IDs and regenerate tokens gives a potential attacker less time to capture a cookie and gain access to server content.

          TLS is a required transmission protocol for a web server hosting controlled information. The use of TLS provides confidentiality of data in transit between the web server and client. FIPS 140-2-approved TLS versions must be enabled and non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be disabled.<br /><br />NIST SP 800-52 defines the approved TLS versions for government applications.

        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Check</h3>
          Review the web server documentation and deployed configuration to determine which version of TLS is being used.<br /><br />If the TLS version is not TLS 1.2 or higher, according to NIST SP 800-52, or if non-FIPS-approved algorithms are enabled, this is a finding.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Fix</h3>
          Configure the web server to use an approved TLS version according to NIST SP 800-52 and to disable all non-approved versions.

          During installation of the web server software, accounts are created for the web server to operate properly. The accounts installed can have either no password installed or a default password, which will be known and documented by the vendor and the user community.<br /><br />The first things an attacker will try when presented with a logon screen are the default user identifiers with default passwords. Installed applications may also install accounts with no password, making the logon even easier. Once the web server is installed, the passwords for any created accounts should be changed and documented. The new passwords must meet the requirements for all passwords, i.e., upper/lower characters, numbers, special characters, time until change, reuse policy, etc.<br /><br />Service accounts or system accounts that have no logon capability do not need to have passwords set or changed.

          Authorization rules can be configured at the server, website, folder (including Virtual Directories), or file level. It is recommended that URL Authorization be configured to only grant access to the necessary security principals. Configuring a global Authorization rule that restricts access ensures inheritance of the settings down through the hierarchy of web directories. This will ensure access to current and future content is only granted to the appropriate principals, mitigating risk of unauthorized access.
