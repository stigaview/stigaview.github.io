       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       The macOS is able to be configured to set an automated termination for 72<br />                hours or less for all temporary or emergency accounts upon account creation.<br /><br />                Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations<br />                where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may<br />                bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during<br />                emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.<br /><br />                Although the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing<br />                system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are<br />                not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove<br />                or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be<br />                created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved.<br /><br />                Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon<br />                accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used<br />                accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency<br />                administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.<br /><br />                To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level<br />                authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.<br /><br />                If temporary or emergency user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period,<br />                these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk,<br />                automated termination of all temporary or emergency accounts must be set to 72 hours (or less) when the<br />                temporary or emergency account is created.<br /><br />                If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the "pwpolicy"<br />                utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set.<br /><br />                If there are no temporary or emergency accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.<br /><br />                Satisfies: SRG-OS-000002-GPOS-00002,SRG-OS-000123-GPOS-00064

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify if a password policy is enforced by a directory service by asking the system<br />                    administrator (SA) or information system security officer (ISSO).<br /><br />                    If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the "pwpolicy"<br />                    utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set.<br /><br />                    If there are no temporary or emergency accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.<br /><br />                    To check if the password policy is configured to disable a temporary or emergency account after 72<br />                    hours, run the following command to output the password policy to the screen, substituting the<br />                    correct user name in place of username:<br /><br />                    /usr/bin/pwpolicy -u username getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2<br /><br />                    If there is no output, and password policy is not controlled by a directory service, this is a<br />                    finding.<br /><br />                    Otherwise, look for the line "<key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key>".<br /><br />                    In the array that follows, there should be a <dict> section that contains a check <string><br />                    that allows users to log in if "policyAttributeCurrentTime" is less than the result of adding<br />                    "policyAttributeCreationTime" to 72 hours (259299 seconds). The check might use a variable defined<br />                    in its "policyParameters" section.<br /><br />                    If the check does not exist or if the check adds too great an amount of time to<br />                    "policyAttributeCreationTime", this is a finding.<br />

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       This setting may be enforced using local policy or by a directory<br />                service.<br /><br />                To set local policy to disable a temporary or emergency user, create a plain text file containing the<br />                following:<br /><br />                <dict><br />                <key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key><br />                <array><br />                <dict><br />                <key>policyContent</key><br />                <string>policyAttributeCurrentTime &lt; policyAttributeCreationTime+259299</string><br />                <key>policyIdentifier</key><br />                <string>Disable Tmp Accounts </string><br />                </dict><br />                </array><br />                </dict><br /><br />                After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new<br />                policy file, substituting the correct user name in place of "username" and the path to the file in place<br />                of "/path/to/file".<br /><br />                /usr/bin/pwpolicy -u username setaccountpolicies /path/to/file<br />
