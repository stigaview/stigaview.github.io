       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the macOS system to display a policy banner by creating an<br />                RTF file containing the required text. Name the file "PolicyBanner.rtfd" and place it in<br />                "/Library/Security/".<br /><br />                Update the permissions of the "/Library/Security/PolicyBanner.rtfd" file with the following command:<br /><br />                /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod 644 /Library/Security/PolicyBanner.rtfd<br />
