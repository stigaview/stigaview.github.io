       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.<br /><br />Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       The "difok" option sets the number of characters in a password that must not be present in the old password.<br /><br />Check for the value of the "difok" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:<br /><br /># grep difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf <br />difok = 8<br /><br />If the value of "difok" is set to less than "8", this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to require the change of at least eight of the total number of characters when passwords are changed by setting the "difok" option.<br /><br />Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):<br /><br />difok = 8
