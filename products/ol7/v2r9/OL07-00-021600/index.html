       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       ACLs can provide permissions beyond those permitted through the file mode and must be verified by file integrity tools.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify ACLs.<br /><br />Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed on the system with the following command:<br /><br /># yum list installed aide<br /><br />If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system. <br /><br />If there is no application installed to perform file integrity checks, this is a finding.<br /><br />Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc" directory. <br /><br />Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:<br /><br /># find / -name aide.conf<br /><br />Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "acl" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists.<br /><br />An example rule that includes the "acl" rule is below:<br /><br />All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux<br />/bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin <br />/sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin <br /><br />If the "acl" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or ACLs are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the file integrity tool to check file and directory ACLs. <br /><br />If AIDE is installed, ensure the "acl" rule is present on all uncommented file and directory selection lists.
