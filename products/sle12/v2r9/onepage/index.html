          A SUSE operating system release is considered "supported" if the vendor continues to provide security patches for the product. With an unsupported release, it will not be possible to resolve security issues discovered in the system software.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Check</h3>
          Verify the SUSE operating system is a vendor-supported release.<br /><br />Use the following command to verify the SUSE operating system is a vendor-supported release:<br /><br /># cat /etc/os-release<br /><br />NAME="SLES"<br /><br />VERSION="12"<br /><br />Current End of Life for SLES 12 General Support is 31 Oct 2024 and Long-term Support is until 31 Oct 2027.<br /><br />If the release is not supported by the vendor, this is a finding.<br />

          <h3>Fix</h3>
          Upgrade the SUSE operating system to a version supported by the vendor. If the system is not registered with the SUSE Customer Center, register the system against the correct subscription.<br /><br />If the system requires Long-Term Service Pack Support (LTSS), obtain the correct LTSS subscription for the system.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep SUSE operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released frequently, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators (SAs) to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in a SUSE operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Check</h3>
          Verify the SUSE operating system security patches and updates are installed and up to date.<br /><br />Note: Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by the site or Program Management Office (PMO).<br /><br />Check for required SUSE operating system patches and updates with the following command:<br /><br /># sudo zypper patch-check<br /><br />0 patches needed (0 security patches)<br /><br />If the patch repository data is corrupt check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command:<br /><br /># cut -d "|" -f 1-4 -s --output-delimiter " | " /var/log/zypp/history | grep -v " radd "<br /><br />2016-12-14 11:59:36 | install | libapparmor1-32bit | 2.8.0-2.4.1<br />2016-12-14 11:59:36 | install | pam_apparmor | 2.8.0-2.4.1<br />2016-12-14 11:59:36 | install | pam_apparmor-32bit | 2.8.0-2.4.1<br /><br />If the SUSE operating system has not been patched within the site or PMO frequency, this is a finding.

          The "sudo" command allows authorized users to run programs (including shells) as other users, system users, and root. The "/etc/sudoers" file is used to configure authorized "sudo" users as well as the programs they are allowed to run. Some configuration options in the "/etc/sudoers" file allow configured users to run programs without re-authenticating. Use of these configuration options makes it easier for one compromised account to be used to compromise other accounts.<br /><br />It is possible to include other sudoers files from within the sudoers file currently being parsed using the #include and #includedir directives. When sudo reaches this line it will suspend processing of the current file (/etc/sudoers) and switch to the specified file/directory. Once the end of the included file(s) are reached, the rest of /etc/sudoers will be processed. Files that are included may themselves include other files. A hard limit of 128 nested include files is enforced to prevent include file loops.

          SUSE operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize a SUSE operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks related to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.<br /><br />This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based on mission needs and the operational environment for each system.

          By limiting the number of failed access attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.<br /><br />The pam_tally2.so module maintains a count of attempted accesses. This includes user name entry into a logon field as well as password entry. With counting access attempts, it is possible to lock an account without presenting a password into the password field.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Emergency accounts are privileged accounts that are established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability. <br /><br />Emergency accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by the organization's system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts are not subject to automatic termination dates. Emergency accounts are accounts created in response to crisis situations, usually for use by maintenance personnel. The automatic expiration or disabling time period may be extended as needed until the crisis is resolved; however, it must not be extended indefinitely. A permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.<br /><br />To address access requirements the SUSE operating system can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

          Verify the SUSE operating system is configured such that emergency administrator accounts are never automatically removed or disabled. <br /><br />Note: Root is typically the "account of last resort" on a system and is also used as the example emergency administrator account. If another account is being used as the emergency administrator account, the command should be used against that account. <br /><br />Check to see if the root account password or account expires with the following command:<br /><br /># sudo chage -l [Emergency_Administrator]<br /><br />Password expires:never<br /><br />If "Password expires" or "Account expires" is set to anything other than "never", this is a finding.

          To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.<br /><br />Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

          SUSE operating systems handling data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest.<br /><br />Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information.

          Configure the SUSE operating system to prevent unauthorized modification of all information at rest by using disk encryption. <br /><br />Encrypting a partition in an already-installed system is more difficult because of the need to resize and change existing partitions. To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout. The standard partitioning proposal as suggested by YaST (installation and configuration tool for Linux) does not include an encrypted partition by default. Add it manually in the partitioning dialog.<br /><br />Refer to the document "SUSE 12 Security Guide", Section 11.1, for a detailed disk encryption guide:<br /><br />https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_security/data/sec_security_cryptofs_y2.html#sec_security_cryptofs_y2_part_run

          Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, and hard disks) after those resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.<br /><br />This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government agencies.<br /><br />There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.

Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.<br /><br />It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs.<br /><br />To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

          It is critical that when the SUSE operating system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required, it takes action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend on the nature of the failure mode.<br /><br />When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: <br /><br />1) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the SUSE operating system must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.<br /><br />2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the SUSE operating system must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

          By default, the SUSE operating system includes the "-a task,never" audit rule as a default. This rule suppresses syscall auditing for all tasks started with this rule in effect. Because the audit daemon processes the "audit.rules" file from the top down, this rule supersedes all other defined syscall rules; therefore no syscall auditing can take place on the operating system.

          DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.<br /><br />This requirement addresses the configuration of the SUSE operating system to mitigate the impact on system availability of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

          To assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, organizational users must be individually identified and authenticated.<br /><br />A group authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. Examples of the group authenticator is the UNIX OS "root" user account, the Windows "Administrator" account, the "sa" account, or a "helpdesk" account.<br /><br />For example, the UNIX and Windows SUSE operating systems offer a "switch user" capability, allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, "switch" to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.<br /><br />Users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) need to be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization, which outlines specific user actions that can be performed on the SUSE operating system without identification or authentication.<br /><br />Requiring individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator allows for traceability of actions, as well as adding an additional level of protection of the actions that can be taken with group account knowledge.

          Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. <br /><br />Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the SUSE operating system level, and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single SUSE operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the SUSE operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000126-GPOS-00066, SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109

          Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.<br /><br />Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.<br /><br />Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.<br /><br />This capability is typically reserved for specific SUSE operating system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance.

          The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding. A system administrator may have a stance in which they want to protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a ''no'' setting.<br />X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.<br />If X11 services are not required for the system's intended function, they should be disabled or restricted as appropriate to the system’s needs.

          Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read, altered, or used to compromise the SUSE operating system.<br /><br />This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with A SUSE operating system. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the AO. Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the SUSE operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.<br /><br />Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000299-GPOS-00117, SRG-OS-000300-GPOS-00118, SRG-OS-000481-GPOS-000481

          Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.<br /><br />A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.<br /><br />When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.<br /><br />This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Virus scanning software can be used to protect a system from penetration from computer viruses and to limit their spread through intermediate systems. <br /><br />The virus scanning software should be configured to perform scans dynamically on accessed files. If this capability is not available, the system must be configured to scan, at a minimum, all altered files on the system on a daily basis.<br /><br />If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, the virus scanner must be configured to scan all received mail.
