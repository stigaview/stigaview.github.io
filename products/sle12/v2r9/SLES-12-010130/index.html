       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       By limiting the number of failed access attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.<br /><br />The pam_tally2.so module maintains a count of attempted accesses. This includes user name entry into a logon field as well as password entry. With counting access attempts, it is possible to lock an account without presenting a password into the password field. This should be taken into consideration as it poses as an avenue for denial of service.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the SUSE operating system locks a user account after three consecutive failed access attempts until the locked account is released by an administrator. <br /><br />Check that the system locks a user account after three consecutive failed login attempts using the following command: <br /><br /># grep pam_tally2.so /etc/pam.d/common-auth <br />auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail deny=3 <br /><br />If no line is returned or the line is commented out, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the line is missing "onerr=fail", this is a finding.<br /><br />If the line has "deny" set to a value other than 1, 2, or 3, this is a finding.<br /><br />Check that the system resets the failed login attempts counter after a successful login using the following command: <br /><br /># grep pam_tally2.so /etc/pam.d/common-account <br />account required pam_tally2.so <br /><br />If the account option is missing, or commented out, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to lock an account when three unsuccessful access attempts occur.<br /><br />Modify the first line of the auth section "/etc/pam.d/common-auth" file to match the following lines:<br /><br />auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail silent audit deny=3<br /><br />Add or modify the following line in the /etc/pam.d/common-account file:<br />account required pam_tally2.so <br /><br />Note: Manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the "pam-config" program. The "pam-config" program should not be used to update the configurations listed in this requirement.
