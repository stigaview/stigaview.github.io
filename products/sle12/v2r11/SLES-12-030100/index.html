       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered. <br /><br />This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all types of information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. <br /><br />Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187, SRG-OS-000424-GPOS-00188, SRG-OS-000425-GPOS-00189, SRG-OS-000426-GPOS-00190

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Note: If the system is not networked this requirement is Not Applicable.<br /><br />Configure the SUSE operating system to implement SSH to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted and received information, as well as information during preparation for transmission.<br /><br />Install the OpenSSH package on the SUSE operating system with the following command:<br /><br /># sudo zypper in openssh<br /><br />Enable the OpenSSH service to start automatically on reboot with the following command:<br /><br /># sudo systemctl enable sshd.service<br /><br />For the changes to take effect immediately, start the service with the following command:<br /><br /># sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
