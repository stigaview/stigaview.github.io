       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       The "sudo" command allows authorized users to run programs (including shells) as other users, system users, and root. The "/etc/sudoers" file is used to configure authorized "sudo" users as well as the programs they are allowed to run. Some configuration options in the "/etc/sudoers" file allow configured users to run programs without re-authenticating. Use of these configuration options makes it easier for one compromised account to be used to compromise other accounts.<br /><br />It is possible to include other sudoers files from within the sudoers file currently being parsed using the #include and #includedir directives. When sudo reaches this line it will suspend processing of the current file (/etc/sudoers) and switch to the specified file/directory. Once the end of the included file(s) are reached, the rest of /etc/sudoers will be processed. Files that are included may themselves include other files. A hard limit of 128 nested include files is enforced to prevent include file loops.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Note: If the "include" and "includedir" directives are not present in the /etc/sudoers file, this requirement is not applicable.<br /><br />Verify the operating system specifies only the default "include" directory for the /etc/sudoers file with the following command:<br /><br />> sudo grep include /etc/sudoers<br /><br />#includedir /etc/sudoers.d<br /><br />If the results are not "/etc/sudoers.d" or additional files or directories are specified, this is a finding.<br /><br />Verify the operating system does not have nested "include" files or directories within the /etc/sudoers.d directory with the following command:<br /><br />> sudo grep -r include /etc/sudoers.d<br /><br />If results are returned, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the /etc/sudoers file to only include the /etc/sudoers.d directory.<br /><br />Edit the /etc/sudoers file with the following command:<br /><br />> sudo visudo<br /><br />Add or modify the following line:<br />#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
