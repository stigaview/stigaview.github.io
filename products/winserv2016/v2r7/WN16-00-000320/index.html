       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws. The operating system may have an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning using ESS and periodic scanning using other tools.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify DoD-approved ESS software is installed and properly operating. Ask the site ISSM for documentation of the ESS software installation and configuration.<br /><br />If the ISSM is not able to provide a documented configuration for an installed ESS or if the ESS software is not properly maintained or used, this is a finding.<br /><br />Note: Example of documentation can be a copy of the site's CCB approved Software Baseline with version of software noted or a memo from the ISSM stating current ESS software and version.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Install a DoD-approved ESS software and ensure it is operating continuously.
