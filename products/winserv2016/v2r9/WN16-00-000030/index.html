       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the password. The built-in Administrator account is not generally used and its password not may be changed as frequently as necessary. Changing the password for the built-in Administrator account on a regular basis will limit its exposure.<br /><br />It is highly recommended to use Microsoft's Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS). Domain-joined systems can configure this to occur more frequently. LAPS will change the password every "30" days by default. The AO still has the overall authority to use another equivalent capability to accomplish the check.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Review the password last set date for the built-in Administrator account.<br /><br />Domain controllers:<br /><br />Open "PowerShell".<br /><br />Enter "Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties SID, PasswordLastSet | Where SID -Like "*-500" | Ft Name, SID, PasswordLastSet".<br /><br />If the "PasswordLastSet" date is greater than "60" days old, this is a finding.<br /><br />Member servers and standalone or nondomain-joined systems:<br /><br />Open "Command Prompt".<br /><br />Enter 'Net User [account name] | Find /i "Password Last Set"', where [account name] is the name of the built-in administrator account.<br /><br />(The name of the built-in Administrator account must be changed to something other than "Administrator" per STIG requirements.)<br /><br />If the "PasswordLastSet" date is greater than "60" days old, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Change the built-in Administrator account password at least every "60" days.<br /><br />It is highly recommended to use Microsoft's LAPS, which may be used on domain-joined member servers to accomplish this. The AO still has the overall authority to use another equivalent capability to accomplish the check.
