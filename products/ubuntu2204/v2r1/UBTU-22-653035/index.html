       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       To ensure operating systems have a sufficient storage capacity in which to write the audit logs, operating systems must be able to allocate audit record storage capacity.  <br />  <br />The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the operating system.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.  <br />  <br />Determine which partition the audit records are being written to by using the following command:  <br />  <br />     $ sudo grep -i log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf <br />     log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log <br />  <br />Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the example being "/var/log/audit/") by using the following command:  <br />  <br />     $ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/ <br />     /dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit <br />  <br />If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records ("/var/log/audit" as a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition by using the following command:  <br />  <br />     $ sudo du -sh <audit_partition> <br />     1.8G /var/log/audit  <br />  <br />Note: The partition size needed to capture a week's worth of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available.  <br />  <br />If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Allocate enough storage capacity for at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.  <br />  <br />If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, use the "parted" program to resize the partition with sufficient space to contain one week's worth of audit records.  <br />  <br />If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, a new partition with sufficient amount of space will need be to be created.  <br />  <br />Set the auditd server to point to the mount point where the audit records must be located:  <br />  <br />     $ sudo sed -i -E 's@^(log_file\s*=\s*).*@\1 <audit_partition_mountpoint>/audit.log@' /etc/audit/auditd.conf  <br />  <br />where <audit_partition_mountpoint> is the aforementioned mount point.
