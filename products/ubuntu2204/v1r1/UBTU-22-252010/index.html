  <h2>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS must, for networked systems, compare internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with a server synchronized to one of the redundant United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers, or a time server designated for the appropriate DOD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet), and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).</h2>

       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.  <br />  <br />Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.  <br />  <br />Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints). <br /> <br />Note that USNO offers authenticated NTP service to DOD and U.S. Government agencies operating on the NIPR and SIPR networks. Visit https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/ntp/DOD-customers for more information.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is configured to compare the system clock at least every 24 hours to the authoritative time source by using the following command: <br /> <br />Note: If the system is not networked, this requirement is not applicable. <br /> <br />     $ sudo grep maxpoll -ir /etc/chrony* <br />     server tick.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 <br />  <br />If the "maxpoll" option is set to a number greater than 16, the line is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding. <br />  <br />Verify that the "chrony.conf" file is configured to an authoritative DOD time source by using the following command:  <br />  <br />     $ sudo grep -ir server /etc/chrony* <br />     server tick.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 <br />     server tock.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 <br />     server ntp2.usno.navy.mil iburst maxpoll 16 <br />  <br />If "server" is not defined, is not set to an authoritative DOD time source, is commented out, or missing, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to compare the system clock at least every 24 hours to the authoritative time source. <br /> <br />Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/chrony/chrony.conf" file: <br />  <br />server [source] iburst maxpoll = 16  <br />  <br />Restart "chrony.service" for the changes to take effect by using the following command:  <br />  <br />     $ sudo systemctl restart chrony.service
