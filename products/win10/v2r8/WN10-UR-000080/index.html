       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high level capabilities.<br /><br />The "Deny log on as a service" right defines accounts that are denied log on as a service.<br /><br />In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.<br /><br />Incorrect configurations could prevent services from starting and result in a DoS.
