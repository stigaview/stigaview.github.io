       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       An account has root authority if it has a user identifier (UID) of "0". Multiple accounts with a UID of "0" afford more opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators access to root privileges in an accountable manner.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify that only the "root" account has a UID "0" assignment with the following command:<br /><br />$ awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd<br /><br />root<br /><br />If any accounts other than "root" have a UID of "0", this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Change the UID of any account on the system, other than root, that has a UID of "0". <br /><br />If the account is associated with system commands or applications, the UID should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000". Otherwise, assign a UID of greater than "1000" that has not already been assigned.
