       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       If an unauthorized or modified device is allowed to exist on the system, there is the possibility the system may perform unintended or unauthorized operations.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized modification.<br /><br />List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the following commands:<br /><br />Note: Device files are normally found under "/dev", but applications may place device files in other directories and may necessitate a search of the entire system.<br /><br /># find /dev -context *:device_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"<br /><br /># find /dev -context *:unlabeled_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"<br /><br />Note: There are device files, such as "/dev/vmci", that are used when the operating system is a host virtual machine. They will not be owned by a user on the system and require the "device_t" label to operate. These device files are not a finding.<br /><br />If there is output from either of these commands, other than already noted, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Restore the SELinux policy for the affected device file from the system policy database using the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo restorecon -v <device_path><br /><br />Substituting "<device_path>" with the path to the affected device file (from the output of the previous commands). An example device file path would be "/dev/ttyUSB0". If the output of the above command does not indicate that the device was relabeled to a more specific SELinux type label, then the SELinux policy of the system must be updated with more specific policy for the device class specified. If a package was used to install support for a device class, that package could be reinstalled using the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo dnf reinstall <package_name><br /><br />If a package was not used to install the SELinux policy for a given device class, then it must be generated manually and provide specific type labels.
