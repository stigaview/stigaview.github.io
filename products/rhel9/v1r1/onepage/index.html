          An operating system release is considered "supported" if the vendor continues to provide security patches for the product. With an unsupported release, it will not be possible to resolve security issues discovered in the system software.<br /><br />Red Hat offers the Extended Update Support (EUS) add-on to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, for a fee, for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific minor release for an extended period.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against the exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Check</h3>
          Verify RHEL 9 security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by organizational policy.<br /><br />Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL for updates is https://access.redhat.com/errata-search/. It is important to note that updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed.<br /><br />Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command:<br /><br />$ dnf history list | more<br /><br />    ID | Command line | Date and time | Action(s) | Altered    <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <br />   70 | install aide | 2023-03-05 10:58 | Install | 1    <br />   69 | update -y | 2023-03-04 14:34 | Update | 18 EE    <br />   68 | install vlc | 2023-02-21 17:12 | Install | 21   <br />   67 | update -y | 2023-02-21 17:04 | Update | 7 EE <br /><br />Typical update frequency may be overridden by Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) notifications from CYBERCOM.<br /><br />If the system is in noncompliance with the organizational patching policy, this is a finding.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Fix</h3>
          Install RHEL 9 security patches and updates at the organizationally defined frequency. If system updates are installed via a centralized repository that is configured on the system, all updates can be installed with the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo dnf update

          The most important characteristic of a random number generator is its randomness, namely its ability to deliver random numbers that are impossible to predict. Entropy in computer security is associated with the unpredictability of a source of randomness. The random source with high entropy tends to achieve a uniform distribution of random values. Random number generators are one of the most important building blocks of cryptosystems.  <br /><br />The rngd service feeds random data from hardware device to kernel random device. Quality (nonpredictable) random number generation is important for several security functions (i.e., ciphers).

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.<br /><br />Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures users with physical access cannot trivially alter important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to use, and whether to enter single-user mode.

          System calls are special routines in the Linux kernel, which userspace applications ask to do privileged tasks. Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace after the system call completes. Virtual system calls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls. This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context switching expense.<br /><br />Virtual system calls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the return instruction pointer. Disabling virtual system calls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns. If the system intends to run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then virtual system calls will need enabled so the components function properly.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000134-GPOS-00068

          ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent execution in memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as a limit in the code segment descriptor, to control where code can be executed, on a per-process basis. When the kernel places a process's memory regions such as the stack and heap higher than this address, the hardware prevents execution in that address range. This is enabled by default on the latest Red Hat and Fedora systems if supported by the hardware.

          RHEL 9 systems handling data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest.<br /><br />Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000405-GPOS-00184, SRG-OS-000185-GPOS-00079, SRG-OS-000404-GPOS-00183

If any partitions other than the boot partition or pseudo file systems (such as /proc or /sys) or temporary file systems (that are tmpfs) are not type "crypto_LUKS", ask the administrator to indicate how the partitions are encrypted.

          It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.<br /><br />Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the server.<br /><br />Compressed ROM/RAM file system (or cramfs) is a read-only file system designed for simplicity and space-efficiency.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.<br /><br />RHEL 9 systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools, and the corresponding rights the user enjoys, to make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.<br /><br />Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.

          Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.<br /><br />This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products.

          "Firewalld" provides an easy and effective way to block/limit remote access to the system via ports, services, and protocols.<br /><br />Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.<br /><br />Remote access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.<br /><br />RHEL 9 functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity. Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000096-GPOS-00050, SRG-OS-000297-GPOS-00115, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00232

          Failure to restrict network connectivity only to authorized systems permits inbound connections from malicious systems. It also permits outbound connections that may facilitate exfiltration of DOD data.<br /><br />RHEL 9 incorporates the "firewalld" daemon, which allows for many different configurations. One of these configurations is zones. Zones can be utilized to a deny-all, allow-by-exception approach. The default "drop" zone will drop all incoming network packets unless it is explicitly allowed by the configuration file or is related to an outgoing network connection.

          Configure the "firewalld" daemon to employ a deny-all, allow-by-exception with the following commands:<br /><br />Start by adding the exceptions that are required for mission functionality to the "drop" zone. If SSH access on port 22 is needed, for example, run the following: "sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh --zone=drop"<br /><br />Reload the firewall rules to update the runtime configuration from the "--permanent" changes made above:<br />$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload<br /><br />Set the default zone to the drop zone:<br />$ sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=drop<br />Note: This is a runtime and permanent change.<br /><br />Add any interfaces to the newly modified "drop" zone:<br />$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --change-interface=ens33<br /><br />Reload the firewall rules for changes to take effect:<br />$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

          To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.<br /><br />Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.

          DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.<br /><br />This requirement addresses the configuration of RHEL 9 to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exists to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

          Some routers will send responses to broadcast frames that violate RFC-1122, which fills up a log file system with many useless error messages. An attacker may take advantage of this and attempt to flood the logs with bogus error logs. Ignoring bogus ICMP error responses reduces log size, although some activity would not be logged.

          SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. "DEBUG" is specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. "INFO" or "VERBOSE" level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.

          Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.<br /><br />Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.<br /><br />RHEL 9 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.<br /><br />Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.<br /><br />RHEL 9 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000126-GPOS-00066, SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109, SRG-OS-000395-GPOS-00175

          A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, the GNOME desktop can be configured to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock. As such, users should not be allowed to change session settings.

          Temporary accounts are privileged or nonprivileged accounts that are established during pressing circumstances, such as new software or hardware configuration or an incident response, where the need for prompt account activation requires bypassing normal account authorization procedures. If any inactive temporary accounts are left enabled on the system and are not either manually removed or automatically expired within 72 hours, the security posture of the system will be degraded and exposed to exploitation by unauthorized users or insider threat actors.<br /><br />Temporary accounts are different from emergency accounts. Emergency accounts, also known as "last resort" or "break glass" accounts, are local logon accounts enabled on the system for emergency use by authorized system administrators to manage a system when standard logon methods are failing or not available. Emergency accounts are not subject to manual removal or scheduled expiration requirements.<br /><br />The automatic expiration of temporary accounts may be extended as needed by the circumstances but it must not be extended indefinitely. A documented permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000123-GPOS-00064, SRG-OS-000002-GPOS-00002

          Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are kept in plain text.<br /><br />Using more hashing rounds makes password cracking attacks more difficult.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000073-GPOS-00041, SRG-OS-000120-GPOS-00061

          Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged functions is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication. A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. The DOD Common Access Card (CAC) with DOD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000375-GPOS-00160, SRG-OS-000105-GPOS-00052

          Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source of events, where events occurred, and the outcome of events, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.<br /><br />Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.<br /><br />Enriched logging aids in making sense of who, what, and when events occur on a system. Without this, determining root cause of an event will be much more difficult.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000255-GPOS-00096, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227

          Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.<br /><br />Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is a required security setting as a number of known vulnerabilities have been reported against Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and earlier versions of TLS. Encryption of private information is essential to ensuring data confidentiality. If private information is not encrypted, it can be intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. SQL Server must use a minimum of FIPS 140-3 approved TLS version 1.2, and all non-FIPS-approved SSL and TLS versions must be disabled. NIST 800-53 specifies the preferred configurations for government systems.<br /><br />Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000250-GPOS-00093, SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187
