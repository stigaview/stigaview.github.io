       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute–force attacks. <br /><br />Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised. Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password changes ensures that newly changed passwords will not resemble previously compromised ones. Note that passwords changed on compromised systems will still be compromised.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the value of the "difok" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo grep difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf<br /><br />difok = 8<br /> <br />If the value of "difok" is set to less than "8", or is commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure RHEL 9 to require the change of at least eight of the total number of characters when passwords are changed by setting the "difok" option.<br /><br />Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):<br /><br />difok = 8
