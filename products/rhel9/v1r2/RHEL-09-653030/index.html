       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       To ensure RHEL 9 systems have a sufficient storage capacity in which to write the audit logs, RHEL 9 needs to be able to allocate audit record storage capacity.<br /><br />The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of RHEL 9.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000341-GPOS-00132, SRG-OS-000342-GPOS-00133

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify RHEL 9 allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.<br /><br />Note: The partition size needed to capture a week of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. Typically 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records should be sufficient.<br /><br />Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf<br />log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log <br /><br />Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to with the following command and verify whether it is sufficiently large:<br /><br /> # df -h /var/log/audit/<br />/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit <br /><br />If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Allocate enough storage capacity for at least one week of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.<br /><br />If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, resize the partition with sufficient space to contain one week of audit records.<br /><br />If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, a new partition with sufficient space will need be to be created.
