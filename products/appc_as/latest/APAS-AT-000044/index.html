       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Any changes to the components of Automation Controller can have significant effects on the overall security of the system.<br /><br />In order to ensure a prompt response to failed application installations and application server upgrades, Automation Controller must provide an automated rollback capability that allows Automation Controller to be restored to a previous known good configuration state prior to the application installation or application server upgrade.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       The administrator must make a backup of the last known good configuration of the Automation Controller on each host.<br /><br />Locate the installer bundle directory that contains the inventory file used to install Ansible Automation Platform.<br /><br />Verify a backup of the last known good configuration has been made and stored in accordance with the Automation Controller Documentation and organizationally defined policy:<br />https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/backup_restore.html<br /><br />If no such backup has been made, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       As System Administrator login to the Controller. Locate the installer bundle directory that contains the inventory file used to install Ansible Automation Platform. From there, run the setup.sh command with the "-b" option to perform a backup.<br /> Example: "[[installation directory]]/setup.sh -b"<br /><br />Note: To revert from a backup, refer to:<br />https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/backup_restore.html
