          An operating system release is considered "supported" if the vendor continues to provide security patches for the product. With an unsupported release, it will not be possible to resolve security issues discovered in the system software.<br /><br />Red Hat offers the Extended Update Support (EUS) add-on to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, for a fee, for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific minor release for an extended period. The RHEL 8 minor releases eligible for EUS are 8.1, 8.2, 8.4, 8.6, and 8.8. Each RHEL 8 EUS stream is available for 24 months from the availability of the minor release. RHEL 8.10 will be the final minor release overall.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.

        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Check</h3>
          Verify the operating system security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by the site or Program Management Office (PMO).<br /><br />Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL for updates is https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/. It is important to note that updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed.<br /><br />Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo yum history list | more<br /><br />Loaded plugins: langpacks, product-id, subscription-manager<br />ID | Command line | Date and time | Action(s) | Altered<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />70 | install aide | 2020-03-05 10:58 | Install | 1 <br />69 | update -y | 2020-03-04 14:34 | Update | 18 EE<br />68 | install vlc | 2020-02-21 17:12 | Install | 21 <br />67 | update -y | 2020-02-21 17:04 | Update | 7 EE<br /><br />If package updates have not been performed on the system within the timeframe the site/program documentation requires, this is a finding.<br /><br />Typical update frequency may be overridden by Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) notifications from CYBERCOM.<br /><br />If the operating system is in non-compliance with the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process, this is a finding.

          Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of using encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the Federal Government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated.<br /><br />RHEL 8 utilizes GRUB 2 as the default bootloader. Note that GRUB 2 command-line parameters are defined in the "kernelopts" variable of the /boot/grub2/grubenv file for all kernel boot entries.  The command "fips-mode-setup" modifies the "kernelopts" variable, which in turn updates all kernel boot entries. <br /><br />The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users must also ensure the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000033-GPOS-00014, SRG-OS-000125-GPOS-00065, SRG-OS-000396-GPOS-00176, SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187, SRG-OS-000478-GPOS-00223

          RHEL 8 systems handling data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest.<br /><br />Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000185-GPOS-00079, SRG-OS-000404-GPOS-00183, SRG-OS-000405-GPOS-00184

          Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated monitoring capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.<br /><br />Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.<br /><br />Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyber attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).

          Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.<br /><br />A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.<br /><br />When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.<br /><br />This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000066-GPOS-00034, SRG-OS-000384-GPOS-00167

          Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.<br /><br />This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government agencies.<br /><br />There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.

          Terminating an idle SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.<br /><br />Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.<br /><br />RHEL 8 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          The most important characteristic of a random number generator is its randomness, namely its ability to deliver random numbers that are impossible to predict.  Entropy in computer security is associated with the unpredictability of a source of randomness.  The random source with high entropy tends to achieve a uniform distribution of random values.  Random number generators are one of the most important building blocks of cryptosystems.<br /><br />The SSH implementation in RHEL8 uses the OPENSSL library, which does not use high-entropy sources by default.  By using the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG environment variable the OPENSSL random generator is reseeded from /dev/random.  This setting is not recommended on computers without the hardware random generator because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be blocked until enough entropy is available.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.<br /><br />Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is a required security setting as a number of known vulnerabilities have been reported against Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and earlier versions of TLS. Encryption of private information is essential to ensuring data confidentiality. If private information is not encrypted, it can be intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. SQL Server must use a minimum of FIPS 140-2-approved TLS version 1.2, and all non-FIPS-approved SSL and TLS versions must be disabled. NIST SP 800-52 specifies the preferred configurations for government systems.<br /><br />Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.<br /><br />The GnuTLS library offers an API to access secure communications protocols.  SSLv2 is not available in the GnuTLS library.  The RHEL 8 system-wide crypto policy defines employed algorithms in the /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/gnutls.config file.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000250-GPOS-00093, SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187

          Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.<br /><br />Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.<br /><br />Notifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.<br /><br />This capability must take into account operational requirements for availability for selecting an appropriate response. The organization may choose to shut down or restart the information system upon security function anomaly detection.<br /><br />RHEL 8 comes with many optional software packages. A file integrity tool called Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is one of those optional packages. This requirement assumes the use of AIDE; however, a different tool may be used if the requirements are met. Note that AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so a cron job is recommended that uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity check.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000363-GPOS-00150, SRG-OS-000446-GPOS-00200, SRG-OS-000447-GPOS-00201

          Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.<br /><br />When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary.

          The "sudo" command allows authorized users to run programs (including shells) as other users, system users, and root. The "/etc/sudoers" file is used to configure authorized "sudo" users as well as the programs they are allowed to run. Some configuration options in the "/etc/sudoers" file allow configured users to run programs without re-authenticating. Use of these configuration options makes it easier for one compromised account to be used to compromise other accounts.<br /><br />It is possible to include other sudoers files from within the sudoers file currently being parsed using the #include and #includedir directives. When sudo reaches this line it will suspend processing of the current file (/etc/sudoers) and switch to the specified file/directory. Once the end of the included file(s) is reached, the rest of /etc/sudoers will be processed. Files that are included may themselves include other files. A hard limit of 128 nested include files is enforced to prevent include file loops.

          Syscalls are special routines in the Linux kernel, which userspace applications ask to do privileged tasks.  Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace after the system call completes.  Virtual Syscalls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls.  This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context switching expense.<br /><br />Virtual Syscalls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the return instruction pointer.  Disabling vsyscalls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns. If the system intends to run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then virtual syscalls will need enabled so the components function properly.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000134-GPOS-00068, SRG-OS-000433-GPOS-00192

          Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not operate correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.<br /><br />This requirement applies to operating systems performing security function verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks related to DoS attacks.<br /><br />This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based on mission needs and the operational environment for each system.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Check</h3>
          Verify the operating system limits the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts and/or account types by issuing the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo grep -r -s '^[^#].*maxlogins' /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.d/*.conf<br /><br />* hard maxlogins 10<br /><br />This can be set as a global domain (with the * wildcard) but may be set differently for multiple domains.<br /><br />If the "maxlogins" item is missing, commented out, or the value is set greater than "10" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement for all domains that have the "maxlogins" item assigned, this is a finding.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Fix</h3>
          Configure the operating system to limit the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts and/or account types.<br /><br />Add the following line to the top of the /etc/security/limits.conf or in a ".conf" file defined in /etc/security/limits.d/:<br /><br />* hard maxlogins 10

          Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. <br /><br />Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000029-GPOS-00010, SRG-OS-000031-GPOS-00012

          A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.<br /><br />The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled.<br /><br />Implementing session settings will have little value if a user is able to manipulate these settings from the defaults prescribed in the other requirements of this implementation guide.<br /><br />Locking these settings from non-privileged users is crucial to maintaining a protected baseline.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000029-GPOS-00010, SRG-OS-000031-GPOS-00012, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227

          Emergency accounts are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.<br /><br />Emergency accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by the organization's system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts are not subject to automatic termination dates. Emergency accounts are accounts created in response to crisis situations, usually for use by maintenance personnel. The automatic expiration or disabling time period may be extended as needed until the crisis is resolved; however, it must not be extended indefinitely. A permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.<br /><br />To address access requirements, many RHEL 8 systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.<br /><br />When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: <br /><br />1) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, RHEL 8 must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary) and overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.<br /><br />2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, RHEL 8 must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

The audit system interprets "-1", "4294967295", and "unset" in the same way.<br /><br />The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall made by all programs on the system.

          Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.<br /><br />Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.<br /><br />It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs.<br /><br />To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

          Failure to restrict network connectivity only to authorized systems permits inbound connections from malicious systems. It also permits outbound connections that may facilitate exfiltration of DoD data.<br /><br />RHEL 8 incorporates the "firewalld" daemon, which allows for many different configurations. One of these configurations is zones. Zones can be utilized to a deny-all, allow-by-exception approach. The default "drop" zone will drop all incoming network packets unless it is explicitly allowed by the configuration file or is related to an outgoing network connection.

Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the Authorizing Official (AO).

          Without authenticating devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity.<br /><br />Peripherals include, but are not limited to, such devices as flash drives, external storage, and printers.<br /><br />A new feature that RHEL 8 provides is the USBGuard software framework. The USBguard-daemon is the main component of the USBGuard software framework. It runs as a service in the background and enforces the USB device authorization policy for all USB devices. The policy is defined by a set of rules using a rule language described in the usbguard-rules.conf file. The policy and the authorization state of USB devices can be modified during runtime using the usbguard tool.<br /><br />The System Administrator (SA) must work with the site Information System Security Officer (ISSO) to determine a list of authorized peripherals and establish rules within the USBGuard software framework to allow only authorized devices.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Check</h3>
          Verify the operating system has enabled the use of the USBGuard with the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo systemctl status usbguard.service<br /><br />usbguard.service - USBGuard daemon<br />Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/usbguard.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)<br />Active: active (running)<br /><br />If the usbguard.service is not enabled and active, ask the SA to indicate how unauthorized peripherals are being blocked.<br />If there is no evidence that unauthorized peripherals are being blocked before establishing a connection, this is a finding.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Fix</h3>
          Configure the operating system to enable the blocking of unauthorized peripherals with the following commands:<br /><br />$ sudo systemctl enable usbguard.service<br /><br />$ sudo systemctl start usbguard.service<br /><br />Note: Enabling and starting usbguard without properly configuring it for an individual system will immediately prevent any access over a usb device such as a keyboard or mouse

          DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.<br /><br />This requirement addresses the configuration of RHEL 8 to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exists to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.<br /><br />Since version 0.6.0, "firewalld" has incorporated "nftables" as its backend support. Utilizing the limit statement in "nftables" can help to mitigate DoS attacks.

          The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding.  A system administrator may have a stance in which they want to protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a "no" setting.<br /><br />X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.<br /><br />If X11 services are not required for the system's intended function, they should be disabled or restricted as appropriate to the system’s needs.

          The FTP service provides an unencrypted remote access that does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session. If a privileged user were to log on using this service, the privileged user password could be compromised. SSH or other encrypted file transfer methods must be used in place of this service.

          Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges. <br /> <br />Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.
