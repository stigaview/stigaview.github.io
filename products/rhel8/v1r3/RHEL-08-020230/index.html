       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.<br /><br />Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to increase exponentially the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.<br /><br />RHEL 8 utilizes "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. Configurations are set in the "etc/security/pwquality.conf" file.<br /><br />The "minlen", sometimes noted as minimum length, acts as a "score" of complexity based on the credit components of the "pwquality" module. By setting the credit components to a negative value, not only will those components be required, they will not count towards the total "score" of "minlen". This will enable "minlen" to require a 15-character minimum.<br /><br />The DoD minimum password requirement is 15 characters.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the operating system enforces a minimum 15-character password length. The "minlen" option sets the minimum number of characters in a new password.<br /><br />Check for the value of the "minlen" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo grep minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf<br />minlen = 15<br /><br />If the command does not return a "minlen" value of 15 or greater, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure operating system to enforce a minimum 15-character password length.<br /><br />Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):<br /><br />minlen = 15
