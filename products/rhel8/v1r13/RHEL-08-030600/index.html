       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.<br /><br />Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).<br /><br />The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.<br /><br />DoD has defined the list of events for which RHEL 8 will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:<br /><br />1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);<br /><br />2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system;<br /><br />3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and <br /><br />4) All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000062-GPOS-00031, SRG-OS-000037-GPOS-00015, SRG-OS-000042-GPOS-00020, SRG-OS-000062-GPOS-00031, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000462-GPOS-00206, SRG-OS-000471-GPOS-00215, SRG-OS-000473-GPOS-00218

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify RHEL 8 generates an audit record when successful/unsuccessful modifications to the "lastlog" file by performing the following command to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules":<br /><br />$ sudo grep -w lastlog /etc/audit/audit.rules<br /><br />-w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins<br /><br />If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful modifications to the "lastlog" file by adding or updating the following rules in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file:<br /><br />-w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins<br /><br />The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
