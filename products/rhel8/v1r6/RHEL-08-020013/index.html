       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.<br /><br />In RHEL 8.2 the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file was incorporated to centralize the configuration of the pam_faillock.so module.  Also introduced is a "local_users_only" option that will only track failed user authentication attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout.<br /><br />From "faillock.conf" man pages: Note that the default directory that "pam_faillock" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the "dir" option.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Note: This check applies to RHEL versions 8.2 or newer, if the system is RHEL version 8.0 or 8.1, this check is not applicable.<br /><br />Verify the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file is configured to lock an account after three unsuccessful logon attempts within 15 minutes:<br /><br />$ sudo grep 'fail_interval =' /etc/security/faillock.conf<br /><br />fail_interval = 900<br /><br />If the "fail_interval" option is not set to "900" or more, is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to lock an account when three unsuccessful logon attempts occur in 15 minutes.<br /><br />Add/Modify the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file to match the following line:<br /><br />fail_interval = 900
