       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.<br /><br />Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.<br /><br />RHEL 8 utilizes "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. The "maxclassrepeat" option sets the maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the same class in the new password.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Check for the value of the "maxclassrepeat" option with the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo grep -r maxclassrepeat /etc/security/pwquality.conf*<br /><br />/etc/security/pwquality.conf:maxclassrepeat = 4<br /><br />If the value of "maxclassrepeat" is set to "0", more than "4" or is commented out, this is a finding.<br />If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to require the change of the number of repeating characters of the same character class when passwords are changed by setting the "maxclassrepeat" option.<br /><br />Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" conf (or modify the line to have the required value):<br /><br />maxclassrepeat = 4
