       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. <br /> <br />Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. <br /> <br />Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use. <br /> <br />This capability is typically reserved for specific Ubuntu operating system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify that all network connections associated with SSH traffic automatically terminate after a period of inactivity. <br /><br />Verify the "ClientAliveCountMax" variable is set in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file by performing the following command:<br /><br />$ sudo grep -ir clientalivecountmax /etc/ssh/sshd_config*<br /><br />ClientAliveCountMax  1<br /><br />If "ClientAliveCountMax" is not set, is not set to "1", or is commented out, this is a finding.<br />If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the Ubuntu operating system to automatically terminate inactive SSH sessions after a period of inactivity. <br /> <br />Modify or append the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file, replacing "[Count]" with a value of 1: <br /> <br />ClientAliveCountMax 1 <br /> <br />Restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect: <br /> <br />$ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
