       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. <br /> <br />Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. <br /> <br />Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use. <br /> <br />This capability is typically reserved for specific operating system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the operating system automatically terminates a user session after inactivity timeouts have expired. <br /> <br />Check that "TMOUT" environment variable is set in the "/etc/bash.bashrc" file or in any file inside the "/etc/profile.d/" directory by performing the following command: <br /> <br />$ grep -E "\bTMOUT=[0-9]+" /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/profile.d/* <br /> <br />TMOUT=600 <br /> <br />If "TMOUT" is not set, or if the value is "0" or is commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to automatically terminate a user session after inactivity timeouts have expired or at shutdown. <br /> <br />Create the file "/etc/profile.d/99-terminal_tmout.sh" file if it does not exist. <br /> <br />Modify or append the following line in the "/etc/profile.d/99-terminal_tmout.sh " file: <br /> <br />TMOUT=600 <br /> <br />This will set a timeout value of 10 minutes for all future sessions. <br /> <br />To set the timeout for the current sessions, execute the following command over the terminal session: <br /> <br />$ export TMOUT=600
