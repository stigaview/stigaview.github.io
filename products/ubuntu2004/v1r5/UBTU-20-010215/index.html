       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       In order to ensure operating systems have a sufficient storage capacity in which to write the audit logs, operating systems need to be able to allocate audit record storage capacity. <br /> <br />The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the operating system.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the Ubuntu operating system allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility. <br /> <br />Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo grep ^log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf <br />log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log <br /> <br />Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the example being "/var/log/audit/") with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo df –h /var/log/audit/ <br />/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit <br /> <br />If the audit records are not written to a partition made specifically for audit records ("/var/log/audit" is a separate partition), determine the amount of space being used by other files in the partition with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo du –sh [audit_partition] <br />1.8G /var/log/audit <br /> <br />Note: The partition size needed to capture a week's worth of audit records is based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. In normal circumstances, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit records will be sufficient. <br /> <br />If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Allocate enough storage capacity for at least one week's worth of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility. <br /> <br />If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, use the "parted" program to resize the partition with sufficient space to contain one week's worth of audit records. <br /> <br />If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, a new partition with sufficient amount of space will need be to be created. <br /> <br />Set the auditd server to point to the mount point where the audit records must be located: <br /> <br />$ sudo sed -i -E 's@^(log_file\s*=\s*).*@\1 <log mountpoint>/audit.log@' /etc/audit/auditd.conf <br /> <br />where <log mountpoint> is the aforementioned mount point.
