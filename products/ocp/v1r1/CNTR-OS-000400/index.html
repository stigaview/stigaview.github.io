       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Direct login as the "root" user must be disabled to prevent unrestricted access and control over the entire system. <br /><br />Terminating an idle session within a short time reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. <br /><br />Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system level network connection. This does not mean that the application terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-APP-000148-CTR-000335, SRG-APP-000190-CTR-000500

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify SSH is restricted from logging on as root and network connections are terminated.<br /><br />Prevent logging on directly as "root" using SSH by executing the following command:<br /><br />for node in $(oc get node -oname); do oc debug $node -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'echo -n "$HOSTNAME "; grep -i PermitRootLogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config' 2>/dev/null; done<br /><br />If the "PermitRootLogin" keyword is set to "yes", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.<br /><br />Verify all network connections associated with SSH traffic are automatically terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity.<br /><br />Check the "ClientAliveCountMax" and ClientAliveInterval by executing the following command:<br /><br />for node in $(oc get node -oname); do oc debug $node -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'echo -n "$HOSTNAME "; grep -i clientalive /etc/ssh/sshd_config<br />' 2>/dev/null; done<br /><br />If "ClientAliveCountMax" do not exist, is not set to a value of "0" in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or is commented out, this is a finding.<br /><br />If "ClientAliveInterval" does not exist, or has a value of > 600 in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or is commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Apply the machine config that disables root and terminates network connections by executing the following:<br /><br />for mcpool in $(oc get mcp -oname | sed "s:.*/::" ); do<br />echo
