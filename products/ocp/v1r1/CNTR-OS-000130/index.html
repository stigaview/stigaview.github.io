       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       OpenShift has countless components where different access levels are needed. To control access, the user must first log into the component and then be presented with a DOD-approved use notification banner before granting access to the component. This guarantees privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       To verify the OpenShift CLI tool is configured to display the DOD Notice and Consent Banner, do either of the following steps:<br /><br />Log in to OpenShift using the oc CLI tool.<br /><br />oc login -u <USER> <OPENSHIFT_URL><br />enter password when prompted<br /><br />If the DOD Notice and Consent Banner is not displayed, this is a finding.<br /><br />Or<br /><br />Verify that motd config map exists and contains the DOD Notice and Consent Banner by executing the following:<br /><br />oc describe configmap/motd -n openshift<br /><br />If the configmap does not exist, or it does not contain the DOD Notice and Consent Banner text in the message data attribute, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       The following command will create a configmap that displays the DOD Notice and Consent Banner when logging in using the OpenShift CLI tool by executing the following:<br /><br />echo 'apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: motd<br />  namespace: openshift<br />data:<br />  message: "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.
