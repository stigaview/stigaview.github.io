       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Integrity of the OpenShift platform is handled by the cluster version operator. The cluster version operator will by default GPG verify the integrity of the release image before applying it. The release image contains a sha256 digest of machine-os-content which is used by the machine config operators for updates. On the host, the container runtime (podman) verifies the integrity of that sha256 when pulling the image before the machine config operator reads its content. Hence, there is end-to-end GPG-verified integrity for the operating system updates (as well as the rest of the cluster components which run as regular containers).

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       To verify integrity of the cluster version, execute the following:<br /><br />oc get clusterversion version <br /><br />If the Cluster Version Operator is not installed or the AVAILABLE is not set to True, this is a finding. <br /><br />Run the following command to retrieve the Cluster Version objects in the system: <br /><br />oc get clusterversion version -o yaml<br /><br />If "verified: true", under status history for each item is not present, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       By default, the integrity of RH CoreOS is checked by cluster version operator on OpenShift platform. If the integrity is not verified, reinstall of the cluster is necessary.<br /><br />Refer to instructions:<br />https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/installing/index.html
