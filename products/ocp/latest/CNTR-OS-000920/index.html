       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorization (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.<br /><br />The Compliance Operator enables continuous compliance monitoring within OpenShift. It regularly assesses the environment against defined compliance policies and automatically detects and reports any deviations. This helps organizations maintain a proactive stance towards compliance, identify potential issues in real-time, and take corrective actions promptly.<br /><br />The Compliance Operator assesses compliance of both the Kubernetes API resources of OpenShift Container Platform, as well as the nodes running the cluster. <br /><br />The Compliance Operator uses OpenSCAP, a NIST-certified tool, to scan and enforce security policies provided by the content. This allows an organization to define organizational policy to align with the SSP, combine it with standardized vendor-provided content, and periodically scan the platform in accordance with organization-defined policy.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       If Red Hat OpenShift Compliance Operator is not used, this check is Not Applicable.<br /><br />The compliance operator must be leveraged to ensure that components are configured in alignment with the SSP at a desired schedule. Install the Compliance Operator by executing the following:<br /><br />oc apply -f - << 'EOF'<br />---<br />apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1<br />kind: Project<br />metadata:<br />  labels:<br />    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-compliance<br />    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"<br />  name: openshift-compliance<br />spec: {}<br />...<br />---<br />apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1<br />kind: OperatorGroup<br />metadata:<br />  name: compliance-operator<br />  namespace: openshift-compliance<br />spec:<br />  targetNamespaces:<br />  - openshift-compliance<br />...<br />---<br />apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1<br />kind: Subscription<br />metadata:<br />  name: compliance-operator<br />  namespace: openshift-compliance<br />spec:<br />  channel: release-0.1<br />  installPlanApproval: Automatic<br />  name: compliance-operator<br />  source: redhat-operators<br />  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace<br />...<br />EOF<br /><br />Following installation of the Compliance Operator, a ScanSettingBinding object that configures the Compliance Operator to use the desired scan cadence must be created. If users have the definition for ScanSettingBinding in a YAML file named my-scansettingbinding.yml, users would apply that ScanSettingBinding by executing the following:<br /><br />oc apply -f my-scansettingbinding.yml -n openshift-compliance<br /><br />For more information about the compliance operator and its use, including the configurability of scheduling of scan cadence in ScanSetting resources and the role-based access control requirements for manually triggered scans, refer to https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-understanding.html.
