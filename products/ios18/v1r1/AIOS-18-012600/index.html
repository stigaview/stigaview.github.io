       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Authorizing official (AO) approval is required before an Apple Watch (DOD-owned or personally owned) can be paired with a DOD-owned iPhone to ensure the AO has evaluated the risk in having sensitive DOD data transferred to and stored on an Apple Watch in their operational environment.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #47

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Determine if the site AO has approved the use of Apple Watch with DOD-owned iPhones. Look for a document showing approval. If not approved, review configuration settings to confirm "Allow Paired Watch" is disabled. If approved, this requirement is not applicable.<br /><br />This a supervised-only control. If the iPhone or iPad being reviewed is not supervised by the MDM, this control is automatically a finding (if the AO has not approved the use of Apple Watch for unmanaged data transfer).<br /><br />If the iPhone or iPad being reviewed is supervised by the MDM, follow these procedures:<br /><br />This check procedure is performed on both the device management tool and the iPhone.<br /><br />Note: If an organization has multiple configuration profiles, the check procedure must be performed on the relevant configuration profiles applicable to the scope of the review.<br /><br />In the iOS management tool, verify "Allow Paired Watch" is unchecked.<br /><br />On the iPhone:<br />1. Open the Settings app.<br />2. Tap "General".<br />3. Tap "VPN & Device Management". <br />4. Tap the Configuration Profile from the iOS management tool containing the restrictions policy.<br />5. Tap "Restrictions".<br />6. Verify "Paired Apple Watch not allowed" is listed.<br /><br />If the AO has not approved pairing an Apple Watch with a DOD-owned iPhone and "Paired Apple Watch not allowed" is not listed both in the management tool and on the Apple device, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       If the AO has not approved the use of Apple Watch with DOD-owned iPhones, install a configuration profile to disable the Apple Watch control in the management tool. This a supervised-only control.
