       Authorizing official (AO) approval is required before an Apple Watch (DOD-owned or personally owned) can be paired with a DOD-owned iPhone to ensure the AO has evaluated the risk in having sensitive DOD data transferred to and stored on an Apple Watch in their operational environment.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #47

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Determine if the site AO has approved the use of Apple Watch with DOD-owned iPhones. Look for a document showing approval. If not approved, this requirement is not applicable.<br /><br />If approved, verify on the MDM server that the Apple Watch is being managed by the MDM. Have the MDM system administrator show that the Apple Watch is being managed by the MDM.<br /><br />If the AO has approved pairing an Apple Watch with a DOD-owned iPhone and the Apple Watch is not being managed by the site MDM server, this is a finding.<br /><br />Note: The iPhone paired to the Apple Watch must be supervised for the MDM to manage the Apple Watch.
