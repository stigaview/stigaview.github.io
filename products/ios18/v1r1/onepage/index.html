          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          The system administrator must have the capability to configure VPN access to meet organization-specific policies based on mission needs. Otherwise, a user could inadvertently or maliciously set up a VPN and connect to a network that poses unacceptable risk to DOD information systems. An adversary could exploit vulnerabilities created by the weaker configuration to compromise DOD sensitive information.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #3
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Check</h3>
          Review the list of unmanaged apps installed on the iPhone and iPad and determine if any unmanaged third-party VPN clients are installed. If so, verify the VPN app is not configured with a DOD network (work) VPN profile. <br /><br />This validation procedure is performed on the iOS device only.<br /><br />On the iPhone and iPad:<br />1. Open the Settings app.<br />2. Tap "General".<br />3. Tap the "VPN and Device Management" line and determine if any "Personal VPN" exists.<br />4. If not, the requirement has been met.<br />5. If there are personal VPNs, open each VPN app. Review the list of VPN profiles configured on the VPN client.<br />6. Verify no DOD network VPN profiles are configured on the VPN client.<br /><br />If any third-party unmanaged VPN apps are installed (personal VPN) and they have a DOD network VPN profile configured on the client, this is a finding.<br /><br />Note: This setting cannot be managed by the MDM administrator and is a User-Based Enforcement (UBE) requirement.

        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Fix</h3>
          If a third-party unmanaged VPN app is installed on the iOS 18 device, do not configure the VPN app with a DOD network VPN profile.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting guessing and brute force attacks. The ability to crack a password is a function of how many attempts an adversary is permitted, how quickly an adversary can do each attempt, and the size of the password space. The longer the minimum length of the password is, the larger the password space. Having a too-short minimum password length significantly reduces password strength, increasing the chance of password compromise and resulting device and data compromise.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #1

          Many mobile devices display notifications on the lock screen so users can obtain relevant information in a timely manner without having to frequently unlock the phone to determine if there are new notifications. However, in many cases, these notifications can contain sensitive information. When they are available on the lock screen, an adversary can see them merely by being in close physical proximity to the device. Configuring the mobile operating system to not send notifications to the lock screen mitigates this risk.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #18

          Before granting access to the system, the mobile operating system is required to display the DOD-approved system use notification message or banner that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Required banners help ensure that DOD can audit and monitor the activities of mobile device users without legal restriction.<br /><br />System use notification messages can be displayed when individuals first access or unlock the mobile device. The banner must be implemented as a "click-through" banner at device unlock (to the extent permitted by the operating system). A "click-through" banner prevents further activity on the information system unless and until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a box indicating "OK".<br /><br />The approved DOD text must be used exactly as required in the Knowledge Service referenced in DODI 8500.01. For devices accommodating banners of 1300 characters, the banner text is: <br /><br />You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. <br />By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions: <br />-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations. <br />-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS. <br />-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose. <br />-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy. <br />-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential.

          App data sharing gives apps the ability to access the data of other apps for enhanced user functionality. However, sharing also poses a significant risk that unauthorized users or apps will obtain access to sensitive DOD information. To mitigate this risk, there are data sharing restrictions. If a user is allowed to make exceptions to the data sharing restriction policy, the user could enable unauthorized sharing of data, leaving it vulnerable to breach. Limiting the granting of exceptions to either the administrator or common application developer mitigates this risk.<br /><br />Copy/paste of data between applications in different application processes or groups of application processes is considered an exception to the access control policy; therefore, the administrator must be able to enable/disable the feature. Other exceptions include allowing any data or application sharing between process groups.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #42, FDP_ACF_EXT.1.2

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Passwords provide a form of access control that prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing computing resources and sensitive data. Passwords may also be a source of entropy for generation of key encryption or data encryption keys. If a password is not required to access data, this data is accessible to any adversary who obtains physical possession of the device. Requiring that a password be successfully entered before the mobile device data is unencrypted mitigates this risk.<br /><br />Note: MDF PP requires a Password Authentication Factor and requires management of its length and complexity. It leaves open whether the  existence of a password is subject to management. This requirement addresses the configuration to require a password, which is critical to the cybersecurity posture of the device.<br /><br />SFRID: FIA_UAU_EXT.1.1

          Ad Tracking refers to the advertisers' ability to categorize the device and spam the user with ads that are most relevant to the user's preferences. By not "Force limiting ad tracking", advertising companies are able to gather information about the user and device's browsing habits. If "Limit Ad Tracking" is not limited, a database of browsing habits of DOD devices can be gathered and stored under no supervision of the DOD.

          DOD root and intermediate PKI certificates are used to verify the authenticity of PKI certificates of users and web services. If the user is allowed to remove root and intermediate certificates, the user could allow an adversary to falsely sign a certificate in such a way that it could not be detected. Restricting the ability to remove DOD root and intermediate PKI certificates to the administrator mitigates this risk.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2 #47

          Auto Unlock allows an Apple Watch to automatically unlock an iPhone or Mac when in close proximity (not available for iPad). This feature allows the iPhone/Mac to be unlocked without the user entering the device passcode, which may lead to unauthorized users access to the iPhone/Mac and sensitive DOD data. This control is not applicable if the authorizing official (AO) has approved the use of Apple Watches.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2 #47
