       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       The more attempts an adversary has to guess a password, the more likely the adversary will enter the correct password and gain access to resources on the device. Setting a limit on the number of attempts mitigates this risk. Setting the limit at 10 or less gives authorized users the ability to make a few mistakes when entering the password but still provides adequate protection against dictionary or brute force attacks on the password.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #2, FIA_AFL_EXT.1.5

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Review configuration settings to confirm that consecutive failed authentication attempts is set to 10 or fewer.<br /><br />This procedure is performed in the Apple iOS/iPadOS management tool and on the iPhone and iPad. <br /><br />Note: If an organization has multiple configuration profiles, the check procedure must be performed on the relevant configuration profiles applicable to the scope of the review. <br /><br />In the Management tool, verify the "Maximum number of failed attempts" value is set to 10 or fewer.<br /><br />Alternatively, verify the text "<key>maxFailedAttempts</key> <integer>10</integer>" appears in the configuration profile (.mobileconfig file). It also is acceptable for the integer value to be less than 10.<br /><br />On the iPhone and iPad: <br />1. Open the Settings app. <br />2. Tap "General".<br />3. Tap "VPN & Device Management".<br />4. Tap the Configuration Profile from the iOS management tool containing the password policy.<br />5. Tap "Restrictions".<br />6. Tap "Passcode".<br />7. Verify "Max failed attempts" is listed as "10" or fewer.<br /><br />If the "Maximum number of failed attempts" is more than 10 in the iOS management tool, "<key>maxFailedAttempts</key> " has an integer value of more than 10, or the password policy on the iPhone and iPad does not list "Max failed attempts" of 10 or fewer, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Install a configuration profile to allow only 10 or fewer consecutive failed authentication attempts.
