       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Managed apps have been approved for the handling of DOD sensitive information. Unmanaged apps are provided for productivity and morale purposes but are not approved to handle DOD sensitive information. Examples of unmanaged apps include those for news services, travel guides, maps, and social networking. If a document were to be viewed in a managed app and the user had the ability to open this same document in an unmanaged app, this could lead to the compromise of sensitive DOD data. In some cases, the unmanaged apps are connected to cloud backup or social networks that would permit dissemination of DOD sensitive information to unauthorized individuals. Not allowing data to be opened within unmanaged apps mitigates the risk of compromising sensitive data.<br /><br />SFRID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #42, FDP_ACF_EXT.1.2
