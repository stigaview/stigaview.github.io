       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to protect information that could be used in credential theft attacks if compromised. There are a number of system requirements that must be met in order for Credential Guard to be configured and enabled properly. Without a TPM enabled and ready for use, Credential Guard keys are stored in a less secure method using software.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify domain-joined systems have a TPM enabled and ready for use.<br /><br />For standalone systems, this is NA.<br /><br />Virtualization-based security, including Credential Guard, currently cannot be implemented in virtual desktop implementations (VDI) due to specific supporting requirements including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run the Hyper-V feature within the virtual desktop.<br /><br />For VDIs where the virtual desktop instance is deleted or refreshed upon logoff, this is NA.<br /><br />Verify the system has a TPM and is ready for use.<br />Run "tpm.msc".<br />Review the sections in the center pane.<br />"Status" must indicate it has been configured with a message such as "The TPM is ready for use" or "The TPM is on and ownership has been taken".<br />TPM Manufacturer Information - Specific Version = 2.0<br /><br />If a TPM is not found or is not ready for use, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       For standalone systems, this is NA.<br /><br />Virtualization-based security, including Credential Guard, currently cannot be implemented in virtual desktop implementations (VDI) due to specific supporting requirements including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run the Hyper-V feature within the virtual desktop.<br /><br />For VDIs where the virtual desktop instance is deleted or refreshed upon logoff, this is NA.<br /><br />Ensure domain-joined systems must have a TPM that is configured for use. (Versions 2.0 support Credential Guard.)<br /><br />The TPM must be enabled in the firmware.<br />Run "tpm.msc" for configuration options in Windows.
