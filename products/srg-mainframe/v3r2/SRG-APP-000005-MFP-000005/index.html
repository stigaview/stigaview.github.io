       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system, but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. <br /><br />The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. This is typically determined and performed at the operating system-level, but in some instances it may be at the application-level.<br /><br />Regardless of where the session lock is determined and implemented, once invoked the session lock must remain in place until the user re-authenticates. No other system or application activity aside from re-authentication must unlock the system.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       If the Mainframe Product has no data screen capability, this requirement is not applicable. <br /><br />Determine whether the Mainframe Product has the capability to retain the session lock until user reestablishes access using established Identification and authentication procedures. If it does not, this is a finding.<br /><br />Examine configuration settings to determine if sessions locks are held until the user reestablishes access. If they are not properly set, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the Mainframe Product setting to retain session locks until user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.
