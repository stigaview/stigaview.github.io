       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       If anomalies are not acted on, security functions may fail to secure the system. <br /><br />Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.<br /><br />Notifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.<br /><br />This requirement applies to applications performing security functions and the applications performing security function verification/testing.
