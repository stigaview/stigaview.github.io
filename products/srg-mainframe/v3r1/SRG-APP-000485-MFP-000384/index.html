       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Without an audit capability, an integrity violation may not be detected. Organizations select response actions based on types of software, specific software, or information for which there are potential integrity violations. The integrity verification application must be configured to perform one or more of following actions: generates an audit record; alerts current user; alerts organization-defined personnel or roles. The organization may define additional actions to be taken.
