       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.<br /><br />This requirement applies to applications with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       If an external security manager (ESM) is in use, check the ESM rules and configuration.<br /><br />If there are no rules for Mainframe Product user datasets or the rules do not restrict access to  Mainframe Product user datasets to authorized users as directed by applicable access control policies, this is a finding. <br /><br />If an ESM is NOT in use, examine installation and configuration settings.<br /><br />If the Mainframe Product does not restrict access to Mainframe Product user datasets to authorized users as directed by applicable access control policies, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the Mainframe Product to limit privileges to changing the software resident within software libraries. <br /><br />This can be accomplished with an ESM.<br /><br />Configure the ESM to restrict update and greater access to Mainframe Product started tasks and job datasets to security administrators in accordance with applicable access control policies.
