       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Failure to provide logical access restrictions associated with changes to application configuration may have significant effects on the overall security of the system. <br /><br />When dealing with access restrictions pertaining to change control, it should be noted that any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. <br /><br />Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals should be allowed to obtain access to application components for the purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. <br /><br />Logical access restrictions include, for example, controls that restrict access to workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Examine Configuration settings.<br /><br />Examine organization change management policies.<br /><br />If the Mainframe Product does not enforce access restriction associated with changes to the application in accordance with change management policies, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the Mainframe Product uses an external security manager (ESM), examine rules for change management access.<br /><br />If there are no rules for this access or access is not restricted to users in accordance with change management policies, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure Mainframe Product change management settings to enforce access restrictions associated with changes to application configuration to appropriate users according to organizational change policies.<br /><br />If the Mainframe Product uses an ESM, configure rules to restrict access associated with application configuration change to appropriate users according to organizational change policies.
