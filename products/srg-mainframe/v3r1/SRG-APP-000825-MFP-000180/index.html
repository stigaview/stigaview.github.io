       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       The purpose of requiring a device that is separate from the system to which the user is attempting to gain access for one of the factors during multifactor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising authenticators or credentials stored on the system. Adversaries may be able to compromise such authenticators or credentials and subsequently impersonate authorized users. Implementing one of the factors on a separate device (e.g., a hardware token), provides a greater strength of mechanism and an increased level of assurance in the authentication process.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the Mainframe Product is configured to implement multifactor authentication for local; network; and/or remote access to privileged accounts; and/or nonprivileged accounts such that the device meets organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements.<br /><br />If the Mainframe Product is not configured to implement multifactor authentication for local; network; and/or remote access to privileged accounts; and/or nonprivileged accounts such that the device meets organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the Mainframe Product to implement multifactor authentication for local; network; and/or remote access to privileged accounts; and/or nonprivileged accounts such that the device meets organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements.
