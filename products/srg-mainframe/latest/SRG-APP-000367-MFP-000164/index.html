       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       The report generation capability must support on-demand reporting in order to facilitate the organization's ability to generate incident reports as needed to better handle larger-scale or more complex security incidents<br /><br />The report generation capability provided by the application must be capable of generating on-demand (i.e., customizable, ad-hoc, and as-needed) reports. On-demand reporting allows personnel to report issues more rapidly to more effectively meet reporting requirements. Collecting log data and aggregating it to present the data in a single, consolidated report achieves this objective. <br /><br />This requirement is specific to applications with report generation capabilities; however, applications need to support on-demand reporting requirements.
