       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       The ability to generate on-demand reports, including after the audit data has been subjected to audit reduction, greatly facilitates the organization's ability to generate incident reports as needed to better handle larger-scale or more complex security incidents. <br /><br />Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. The report generation capability provided by the application must support on-demand (i.e., customizable, ad-hoc, and as-needed) reports.<br /><br />This requirement is specific to applications with audit reduction capabilities; however, applications need to support on-demand audit review and analysis.
