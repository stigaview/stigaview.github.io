       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Without the capability to select a user session to capture/record or view/hear, investigations into suspicious or harmful events would be hampered by the volume of information captured. The volume of information captured may also adversely impact the operation for the network.<br /><br />Session audits may include monitoring keystrokes, tracking websites visited, and recording information and/or file transfers.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       If the Mainframe Product has no function or capability for session operations, this is not applicable.<br /><br />Examine installation and configuration settings.<br /><br />Verify that the Mainframe Product has the capability to select user sessions for monitoring and allows system programmers and security administrators to select sessions to capture/record or view/hear in accordance with applicable access control policies. <br /><br />If it does not, this is a finding.<br /><br />If there is an external security manager (ESM) in use, verify that the ESM restricts the ability to select sessions to capture/record or view/hear in accordance with applicable access control policies to system programmers or security administrators. <br /><br />If it does not, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the Mainframe Product to permit authorized users to select a user session to capture/record or view/hear.<br /><br />If there is an ESM in use, configure ESM to restrict the ability to select sessions to capture/record or view/hear in accordance with applicable access control policies to system programmers or security administrators.
