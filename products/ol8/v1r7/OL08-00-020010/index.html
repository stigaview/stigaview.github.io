       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account. <br /> <br />OL 8 can use the "pam_faillock.so" for this purpose. Note that manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the "authselect" program. <br /> <br />From "Pam_Faillock" man pages: Note that the default directory that "pam_faillock" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable, a different tally directory must be set with the "dir" option.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the system locks an account after three unsuccessful logon attempts with the following commands. <br /> <br />Note: If the System Administrator demonstrates the use of an approved centralized account management method that locks an account after three unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes, this requirement is not applicable. <br /> <br />Note: This check applies to OL versions 8.0 and 8.1. If the system is OL version 8.2 or newer, this check is not applicable. <br /> <br />$ sudo grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/password-auth <br /> <br />auth required pam_faillock.so preauth dir=/var/log/faillock silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=0 <br />auth required pam_faillock.so authfail dir=/var/log/faillock unlock_time=0 <br />account required pam_faillock.so <br /> <br />If the "deny" option is not set to "3" or less (but not "0") on the "preauth" line with the "pam_faillock.so" module or is missing from this line, this is a finding. <br /> <br />If any line referencing the "pam_faillock.so" module is commented out, this is a finding. <br /> <br />$ sudo grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/system-auth <br /> <br />auth required pam_faillock.so preauth dir=/var/log/faillock silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=0 <br />auth required pam_faillock.so authfail dir=/var/log/faillock unlock_time=0 <br />account required pam_faillock.so <br /> <br />If the "deny" option is not set to "3" or less (but not "0") on the "preauth" line with the "pam_faillock.so" module or is missing from this line, this is a finding. <br /> <br />If any line referencing the "pam_faillock.so" module is commented out, this is a finding.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Add/modify the appropriate sections of the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" files to match the following lines: <br /> <br />auth required pam_faillock.so preauth dir=/var/log/faillock silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=0 <br />auth required pam_faillock.so authfail dir=/var/log/faillock unlock_time=0 <br />account required pam_faillock.so <br /> <br />The "sssd" service must be restarted for the changes to take effect. To restart the "sssd" service, run the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo systemctl restart sssd.service
