       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate. <br /> <br />Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. <br /> <br />Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints). <br /> <br />If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis. <br /> <br />Time stamps generated by the operating system include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. <br /> <br />OL 8 uses the "timedatectl" command to view the status of the "systemd-timesyncd.service". The "timedatectl" status will display the local time, UTC, and the offset from UTC. <br /> <br />Note that USNO offers authenticated NTP service to DoD and U.S. Government agencies operating on the NIPR and SIPR networks.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify OL 8 is comparing internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with an NTP server with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo grep maxpoll /etc/chrony.conf <br /> <br />server [ntp.server.name] iburst maxpoll 16 <br /> <br />If the "maxpoll" option is set to a number greater than "16" or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure OL 8 to compare internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with an NTP server by adding/modifying the following line in the "/etc/chrony.conf" file. <br /> <br />server [ntp.server.name] iburst maxpoll 16
