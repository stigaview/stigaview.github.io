       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. <br /> <br />Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised. <br /> <br />OL 8 uses pwquality as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. Note that in order to require lowercase characters without degrading the "minlen" value, the credit value must be expressed as a negative number in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf".

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the value for "lcredit" in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" or "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf" files with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo grep -r lcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf*<br /> <br />/etc/security/pwquality.conf:lcredit = -1 <br /> <br />If the value of "lcredit" is a positive number or is commented out, this is a finding.<br />If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure OL 8 to enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one lowercase character be used by setting the "lcredit" option.<br /><br />Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a configuration file in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/" directory:<br /><br />lcredit = -1<br /><br />Remove any configurations that conflict with the above value.
