       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Extended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data and file metadata with security implications. <br /> <br />OL 8 installation media come with a file integrity tool, Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE).
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify extended attributes. <br /> <br />If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system. <br /> <br />Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. This requirement assumes the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc" directory. <br /> <br />Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location: <br /> <br />$ sudo find / -name aide.conf <br /> <br />Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "xattrs" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists. <br /> <br />An example rule that includes the "xattrs" rule follows: <br /> <br />All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux <br />/bin All # apply the custom rule to the files in bin <br />/sbin All # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin <br /> <br />If the "xattrs" rule is not being used on all uncommented selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or extended attributes are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the file integrity tool to check file and directory extended attributes. <br /> <br />If AIDE is installed, ensure the "xattrs" rule is present on all uncommented file and directory selection lists.
