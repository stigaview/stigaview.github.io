       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to increase exponentially the time and/or resources required to compromise the password. <br /> <br />OL 8 uses "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. Configurations are set in the "etc/security/pwquality.conf" file. <br /> <br />The "minlen", sometimes noted as minimum length, acts as a "score" of complexity based on the credit components of the "pwquality" module. By setting the credit components to a negative value, not only will those components be required, but they will not count toward the total "score" of "minlen". This will enable "minlen" to require a 15-character minimum.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the operating system enforces a minimum 15-character password length. The "minlen" option sets the minimum number of characters in a new password. <br /> <br />Check for the value of the "minlen" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" or "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf" files with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo grep -r minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf*<br /> <br />/etc/security/pwquality.conf:minlen = 15 <br /> <br />If the command does not return a "minlen" value of 15 or greater or is commented out, this is a finding.<br />If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure OL 8 to enforce a minimum 15-character password length. <br /> <br />Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a configuration file in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/" directory: <br /> <br />minlen = 15
