       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. <br /> <br />Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised. <br /> <br />OL 8 uses "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. The "difok" option sets the number of characters in a password that must not be present in the old password.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the value of the "difok" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" or "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf" files with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo grep -r difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf*<br /> <br />/etc/security/pwquality.conf:difok = 8 <br /> <br />If the value of "difok" is set to less than "8" or is commented out, this is a finding.<br />If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure OL 8 to require the change of at least eight of the total number of characters when passwords are changed by setting the "difok" option.<br /><br />Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a configuration file in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/" directory:<br /><br />difok = 8<br /><br />Remove any configurations that conflict with the above value.
