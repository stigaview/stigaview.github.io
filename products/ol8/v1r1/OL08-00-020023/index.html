       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account. <br /> <br />In OL 8.2, the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file was incorporated to centralize the configuration of the "pam_faillock.so" module. Also introduced is a "local_users_only" option that will only track failed user authentication attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout. <br /> <br />From "faillock.conf" man pages: Note that the default directory that "pam_faillock" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable, a different tally directory must be set with the "dir" option.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005, SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Note: This check applies to OL versions 8.2 or newer. If the system is OL version 8.0 or 8.1, this check is not applicable. <br /> <br />Verify the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file is configured to log user name information when unsuccessful logon attempts occur: <br /> <br />$ sudo grep even_deny_root /etc/security/faillock.conf <br /> <br />even_deny_root <br /> <br />If the "even_deny_root" option is not set or is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to include root when locking an account after three unsuccessful logon attempts occur in 15 minutes.<br /> <br />Add/modify the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file to match the following line: <br /> <br />even_deny_root
