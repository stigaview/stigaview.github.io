       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf <br /> <br />hosts: files dns <br /> <br />If the DNS entry is missing from the host's line in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty. <br /> <br />Verify the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is empty with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo ls -al /etc/resolv.conf <br /> <br />-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf <br /> <br />If local host authentication is being used and the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is not empty, this is a finding. <br /> <br />If the DNS entry is found on the host's line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file, verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution. <br /> <br />Determine the name servers used by the system with the following command: <br /> <br />$ sudo grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf <br /> <br />nameserver 192.168.1.2 <br />nameserver 192.168.1.3 <br /> <br />If fewer than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure OL 8 to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution. <br /> <br />By default, "NetworkManager" on OL 8 dynamically updates the "/etc/resolv.conf" file with the DNS settings from active "NetworkManager" connection profiles. However, this feature can be disabled to allow manual configurations. <br /> <br />If manually configuring DNS, edit the "/etc/resolv.conf" file to uncomment or add the two or more "nameserver" option lines with the IP address of local authoritative name servers.  <br /> <br />If local host resolution is being performed, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty. An empty "/etc/resolv.conf" file can be created as follows: <br /> <br />$ sudo echo -n > /etc/resolv.conf
