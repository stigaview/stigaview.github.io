       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Successful incident response and auditing relies on timely, accurate system information and analysis in order to allow the organization to identify and respond to potential incidents in a proficient manner. If the operating system does not provide the ability to centrally review the operating system logs, forensic analysis is negatively impacted.<br /><br />Segregation of logging data to multiple disparate computer systems is counterproductive and makes log analysis and log event alarming difficult to implement and manage, particularly when the system has multiple logging components writing to different locations or systems.<br /><br />To support the centralized capability, the operating system must be able to provide the information in a format that can be extracted and used, allowing the application performing the centralization of the log records to meet this requirement.
