       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws.<br /><br />To support this requirement, the operating system may have an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning using ESS and periodic scanning using other tools, as specified in the requirement.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the operating system employs automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: continuously, where ESS is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by ESS; and annually, for external scans by CNDSP.<br /><br />If it does not, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to employ automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: continuously, where ESS is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by ESS; and annually, for external scans by CNDSP.
