       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       In order to ensure operating systems have a sufficient storage capacity in which to write the audit logs, operating systems need to be able to allocate audit record storage capacity.<br /><br />The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the operating system.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the operating system allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records, when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility. If it does not, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to allocate audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of audit records, when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.
