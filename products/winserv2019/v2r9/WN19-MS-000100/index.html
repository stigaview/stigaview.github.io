       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.<br /><br />The "Deny log on as a service" user right defines accounts that are denied logon as a service.<br /><br />In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower-trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.<br /><br />Incorrect configurations could prevent services from starting and result in a denial of service.

       This applies to member servers only. A separate version applies to domain controllers.<br /><br />Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.<br /><br />Run "gpedit.msc".<br /><br />Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.<br /><br />If the following accounts or groups are not defined for the "Deny log on as a service" user right on domain-joined systems, this is a finding:<br /><br />- Enterprise Admins Group<br />- Domain Admins Group<br /><br />If any accounts or groups are defined for the "Deny log on as a service" user right on nondomain-joined systems, this is a finding.<br /><br />For server core installations, run the following command:<br /><br />Secedit /Export /Areas User_Rights /cfg c:\path\filename.txt<br /><br />Review the text file.<br /><br />If the following SIDs are not defined for the "SeDenyServiceLogonRight" user right on domain-joined systems, this is a finding:<br /><br />S-1-5-root domain-519 (Enterprise Admins)<br />S-1-5-domain-512 (Domain Admins)<br /><br />If any SIDs are defined for the user right, this is a finding.
