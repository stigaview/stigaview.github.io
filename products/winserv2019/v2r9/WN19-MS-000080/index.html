       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.<br /><br />The "Deny access to this computer from the network" user right defines the accounts that are prevented from logging on from the network.<br /><br />In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower-trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.<br /><br />Local accounts on domain-joined systems must also be assigned this right to decrease the risk of lateral movement resulting from credential theft attacks.<br /><br />The Guests group must be assigned this right to prevent unauthenticated access.

       This applies to member servers and standalone or nondomain-joined systems. A separate version applies to domain controllers.<br /><br />Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.<br /><br />Run "gpedit.msc".<br /><br />Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.<br /><br />If the following accounts or groups are not defined for the "Deny access to this computer from the network" user right, this is a finding:<br /><br />Domain Systems Only:<br />- Enterprise Admins group<br />- Domain Admins group<br />- "Local account and member of Administrators group" or "Local account" (see Note below)<br /><br />All Systems:<br />- Guests group<br /><br />For server core installations, run the following command:<br /><br />Secedit /Export /Areas User_Rights /cfg c:\path\filename.txt<br /><br />Review the text file.<br /><br />If the following SIDs are not defined for the "SeDenyNetworkLogonRight" user right, this is a finding.<br /><br />Domain Systems Only:<br />S-1-5-root domain-519 (Enterprise Admins)<br />S-1-5-domain-512 (Domain Admins)<br />S-1-5-114 ("Local account and member of Administrators group") or S-1-5-113 ("Local account")<br /><br />All Systems:<br />S-1-5-32-546 (Guests)<br /><br />Note: These are built-in security groups.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment >> "Deny access to this computer from the network" to include the following:<br /><br />Domain Systems Only:<br />- Enterprise Admins group<br />- Domain Admins group<br />- "Local account and member of Administrators group" or "Local account" (see Note below)<br /><br />All Systems:<br />- Guests group<br /><br />Note: These are built-in security groups.
