       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Setting application account passwords to expire may cause applications to stop functioning. However, not changing them on a regular basis exposes them to attack. If managed service accounts are used, this alleviates the need to manually change application account passwords.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Determine if manually managed application/service accounts exist. If none exist, this is NA.<br /><br />If passwords for manually managed application/service accounts are not changed at least annually or when an administrator with knowledge of the password leaves the organization, this is a finding.<br /><br />Identify manually managed application/service accounts.<br /><br />To determine the date a password was last changed:<br /><br />Domain controllers:<br /><br />Open "PowerShell".<br /><br />Enter "Get-AdUser -Identity [application account name] -Properties PasswordLastSet | FT Name, PasswordLastSet", where [application account name] is the name of the manually managed application/service account.<br /><br />If the "PasswordLastSet" date is more than one year old, this is a finding.<br /><br />Member servers and standalone or nondomain-joined systems:<br /><br />Open "Command Prompt".<br /><br />Enter 'Net User [application account name] | Find /i "Password Last Set"', where [application account name] is the name of the manually managed application/service account.<br /><br />If the "Password Last Set" date is more than one year old, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Change passwords for manually managed application/service accounts at least annually or when an administrator with knowledge of the password leaves the organization.<br /><br />It is recommended that system-managed service accounts be used whenever possible.
