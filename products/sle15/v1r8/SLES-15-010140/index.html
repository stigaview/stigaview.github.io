       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.<br /><br />The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. The SUSE operating system session lock event must include an obfuscation of the display screen to prevent other users from reading what was previously displayed.<br /><br />Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, such as patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, a clock, a battery life indicator, or a blank screen, with the additional caveat that none of the images conveys sensitive information.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify the SUSE operating system conceals via the session lock information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image in the GUI.<br /><br />Note: If the system does not have X Windows installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.<br /><br />Check that the lock screen is set to a publicly viewable image by running the following command:<br /><br />> sudo gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver picture-uri <br />'file:///usr/share/wallpapers/SLE-default-static.xml'<br /><br />If nothing is returned or "org.gnome.desktop.screensaver" is not set, this is a finding.
