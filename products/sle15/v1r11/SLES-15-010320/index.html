       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.<br /><br />Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.<br /><br />Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.<br /><br />This capability is typically reserved for specific SUSE operating system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance.

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify that all network connections associated with SSH traffic are automatically terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity.<br /><br />Check that the "ClientAliveCountMax" variable is set to a value of "0" or less by performing the following command:<br /><br />> sudo grep -i clientalive /etc/ssh/sshd_config<br /><br />ClientAliveInterval 600<br /><br />ClientAliveCountMax 0<br /><br />If "ClientAliveCountMax" does not exist or "ClientAliveCountMax" is not set to a value of "0" or less in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the SUSE operating system to automatically terminate all network connections associated with SSH traffic at the end of a session or after a 10-minute period of inactivity.<br /><br />Modify or append the following lines in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file:<br /><br />ClientAliveCountMax 0<br /><br />In order for the changes to take effect, the SSH daemon must be restarted.<br /><br />> sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
