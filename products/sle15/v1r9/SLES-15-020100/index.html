       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       If an account other than root also has a User Identifier (UID) of "0", it has root authority, giving that account unrestricted access to the entire SUSE operating system. Multiple accounts with a UID of "0" afford an opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for a privileged account.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Verify that the SUSE operating system root account is the only account with unrestricted access to the system.<br /><br />Check the system for duplicate UID "0" assignments with the following command:<br /><br />> awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd<br /><br />root<br /><br />If any accounts other than root have a UID of "0", this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Change the UID of any account on the SUSE operating system, other than the root account, that has a UID of "0". <br /><br />If the account is associated with system commands or applications, the UID should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000". Otherwise, assign a UID of greater than "1000" that has not already been assigned.
