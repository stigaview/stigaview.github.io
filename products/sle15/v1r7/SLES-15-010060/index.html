       The banner must be acknowledged by the user prior to allowing the user access to the SUSE operating system. This provides assurance that the user has seen the message and accepted the conditions for access. If the consent banner is not acknowledged by the user, DoD will not be in compliance with system use notifications required by law.<br /><br />To establish acceptance of the application usage policy, a click-through banner at system logon is required. The system must prevent further activity until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a box indicating "OK".
