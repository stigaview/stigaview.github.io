       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Using applications that access the internet or have potential internet sources using administrative privileges exposes a system to compromise. If a flaw in an application is exploited while running as a privileged user, the entire system could be compromised. Web browsers and email are common attack vectors for introducing malicious code and must not be run with an administrative account.<br /><br />Since administrative accounts may generally change or work around technical restrictions for running a web browser or other applications, it is essential that policy require administrative accounts to not access the internet or use applications such as email.<br /><br />The policy must define specific exceptions for local service administration. These exceptions may include HTTP(S)-based tools that are used for the administration of the local system, services, or attached devices.<br /><br />Whitelisting can be used to enforce the policy to ensure compliance.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000205-GPOS-00083

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Determine whether organization policy, at a minimum, prohibits administrative accounts from using applications that access the internet, such as web browsers, or with potential internet sources, such as email, except as necessary for local service administration.<br /><br />If it does not, this is a finding.<br /><br />The organization may use technical means such as whitelisting to prevent the use of browsers and mail applications to enforce this requirement.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Establish a policy, at minimum, to prohibit administrative accounts from using applications that access the internet, such as web browsers, or with potential internet sources, such as email. Ensure the policy is enforced.<br /><br />The organization may use technical means such as whitelisting to prevent the use of browsers and mail applications to enforce this requirement.
