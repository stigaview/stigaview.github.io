       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000329-GPOS-00128, SRG-OS-000021-GPOS-00005

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Check that the system locks an account for a minimum of 15 minutes after three unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes with the following command:<br /><br /># grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/password-auth<br /><br />auth required pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=900<br />auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=900<br />account required pam_faillock.so <br /><br />If the "deny" parameter is set to "0" or a value greater than "3" on both "auth" lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module, or is missing from these lines, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the "even_deny_root" parameter is not set on both "auth" lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module, or is missing from these lines, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the "fail_interval" parameter is set to "0" or is set to a value less than "900" on both "auth" lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module, or is missing from these lines, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the "unlock_time" parameter is not set to "0", "never", or is set to a value less than "900" on both "auth" lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module, or is missing from these lines, this is a finding.<br /><br />Note: The maximum configurable value for "unlock_time" is "604800". <br /><br />If any line referencing the "pam_faillock.so" module is commented out, this is a finding.<br /><br /># grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/system-auth<br /><br />auth required pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=900<br />auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=900<br />account required pam_faillock.so <br /><br />If the "deny" parameter is set to "0" or a value greater than "3" on both "auth" lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module, or is missing from these lines, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the "even_deny_root" parameter is not set on both "auth" lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module, or is missing from these lines, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the "fail_interval" parameter is set to "0" or is set to a value less than "900" on both "auth" lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module, or is missing from these lines, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the "unlock_time" parameter is not set to "0", "never", or is set to a value less than "900" on both "auth" lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module or is missing from these lines, this is a finding.<br /><br />Note: The maximum configurable value for "unlock_time" is "604800". <br /><br />If any line referencing the "pam_faillock.so" module is commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to lock an account for the maximum period when three unsuccessful logon attempts in 15 minutes are made.<br /><br />Add/Modify the appropriate sections of the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" files to match the following lines:<br /><br />auth required pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=900<br />auth sufficient pam_unix.so try_first_pass<br />auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=900<br />account required pam_faillock.so   <br /><br />Note: Manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the "authconfig" program. The "authconfig" program should not be used to update the configurations listed in this requirement.
