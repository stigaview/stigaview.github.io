          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.<br /><br />Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).<br /><br />The rsh-server service provides an unencrypted remote access service that does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session and has very weak authentication.<br /><br />If a privileged user were to log on using this service, the privileged user password could be compromised.

          Verify the operating system notifies designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.<br /><br />Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed and notify specified individuals via email or an alert.<br /><br />Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:<br /><br /># yum list installed aide<br /><br />If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the system. <br /><br />Check for the presence of a cron job running routinely on the system that executes AIDE to scan for changes to the system baseline. The commands used in the example will use a daily occurrence.<br /><br />Check the cron directories for a "crontab" script file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:<br /><br /># ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide<br />-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 32 Jul 1 2011 aide<br /><br /># grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root<br />/etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide  --check<br />/var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * /usr/sbin/aide  --check<br /><br />AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so the cron job uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity run as in the following example:<br /><br /># more /etc/cron.daily/aide<br />#!/bin/bash<br /><br />/usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run" root@sysname.mil<br /><br />If the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is a finding.
        </div>
        <div class="span1">
          <h3>Fix</h3>
          Configure the operating system to notify designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner. The AIDE tool can be configured to email designated personnel with the use of the cron system. <br /><br />The following example output is generic. It will set cron to run AIDE daily and to send email at the completion of the analysis. <br /><br /># more /etc/cron.daily/aide<br /><br />/usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run" root@sysname.mil

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.

          If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no place for the storage and control of files they should own.<br /><br />In addition, if a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist, the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility to system files they normally would not be able to access.

          The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current working directory (other than the user's home directory), executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory.

          The umask controls the default access mode assigned to newly created files. A umask of 077 limits new files to mode 700 or less permissive. Although umask can be represented as a four-digit number, the first digit representing special access modes is typically ignored or required to be "0". This requirement applies to the globally configured system defaults and the local interactive user defaults for each account on the system.

          It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.<br /><br />Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).<br /><br />Examples of non-essential capabilities include, but are not limited to, games, software packages, tools, and demonstration software not related to requirements or providing a wide array of functionality not required for every mission, but which cannot be disabled.

          Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. <br /><br />Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection.

          The security risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests forwarding. A system administrator may have a stance in which they want to protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a ''no'' setting.<br />X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.<br />If X11 services are not required for the system's intended function, they should be disabled or restricted as appropriate to the system’s needs.

          <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
          The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into the organization's network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point (AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of service to valid network resources.
