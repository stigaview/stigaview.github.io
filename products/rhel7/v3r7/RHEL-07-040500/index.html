       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.<br /><br />Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.<br /><br />Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints).<br /><br />Satisfies: SRG-OS-000355-GPOS-00143, SRG-OS-000356-GPOS-00144

       <h3>Check</h3>
       Check to see if NTP is running in continuous mode:<br /><br /># ps -ef | grep ntp<br /><br />If NTP is not running, check to see if "chronyd" is running in continuous mode:<br /><br /># ps -ef | grep chronyd<br /><br />If NTP or "chronyd" is not running, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the NTP process is found, then check the "ntp.conf" file for the "maxpoll" option setting:<br /><br /># grep maxpoll /etc/ntp.conf<br /><br />server 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst maxpoll 16<br /><br />If the "maxpoll" option is set to a number greater than 16 or the line is commented out, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the file does not exist, check the "/etc/cron.daily" subdirectory for a crontab file controlling the execution of the "ntpd -q" command.<br /><br /># grep -i "ntpd -q" /etc/cron.daily/*<br /># ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep ntp<br /><br />ntp<br /><br />If a crontab file does not exist in the "/etc/cron.daily" that executes the "ntpd -q" command, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the "chronyd" process is found, then check the "chrony.conf" file for the "maxpoll" option setting:<br /><br /># grep maxpoll /etc/chrony.conf<br /><br />server 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst maxpoll 16<br /><br />If the option is not set or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Edit the "/etc/ntp.conf" or "/etc/chrony.conf" file and add or update an entry to define "maxpoll" to "16" as follows:<br /><br />server 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst maxpoll 16<br /><br />If NTP was running and "maxpoll" was updated, the NTP service must be restarted:<br /><br /># systemctl restart ntpd<br /><br />If NTP was not running, it must be started:<br /><br /># systemctl start ntpd <br /><br />If "chronyd" was running and "maxpoll" was updated, the service must be restarted:<br /><br /># systemctl restart chronyd.service<br /><br />If "chronyd" was not running, it must be started:<br /><br /># systemctl start chronyd.service
