       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.<br /><br />Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Note: The value to require a number of numeric characters to be set is expressed as a negative number in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf".<br /><br />Check the value for "dcredit" in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:<br /><br /># grep dcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf <br />dcredit = -1 <br /><br />If the value of "dcredit" is not set to a negative value, this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one numeric character be used by setting the "dcredit" option.<br /><br />Add the following line to /etc/security/pwquality.conf (or modify the line to have the required value):<br /><br />dcredit = -1
