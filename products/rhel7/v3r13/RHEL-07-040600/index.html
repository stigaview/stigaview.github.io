       <h3>Vulnerability Discussion</h3>
       To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Check</h3>
       Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the following command:<br /><br /># grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf<br />hosts: files dns<br /><br />If the DNS entry is missing from the host's line in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty.<br /><br />Verify the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is empty with the following command:<br /><br /># ls -al /etc/resolv.conf<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf<br /><br />If local host authentication is being used and the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is not empty, this is a finding.<br /><br />If the DNS entry is found on the host's line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file, verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.<br /><br />Determine the name servers used by the system with the following command:<br /><br /># grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf<br />nameserver 192.168.1.2<br />nameserver 192.168.1.3<br /><br />If less than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding.<br /><br />Verify that the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is immutable with the following command:<br /><br /># sudo lsattr /etc/resolv.conf<br /><br />----i----------- /etc/resolv.conf<br /><br />If the file is mutable and has not been documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.
     </div>
     <div class="span1">
       <h3>Fix</h3>
       Configure the operating system to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.<br /><br />Edit the "/etc/resolv.conf" file to uncomment or add the two or more "nameserver" option lines with the IP address of local authoritative name servers. If local host resolution is being performed, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty. An empty "/etc/resolv.conf" file can be created as follows:<br /><br /># echo -n > /etc/resolv.conf<br /><br />And then make the file immutable with the following command:<br /><br /># chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf<br /><br />If the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be mutable, the required configuration must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and the file must be verified by the system file integrity tool.
